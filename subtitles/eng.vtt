00:08.940 --> 00:11.270
<i> It's been a while since I was</i>

00:11.330 --> 00:14.610
<i> ...up here in front of you maybe i'll stick to the cards</i>

00:17.280 --> 00:21.500
<i>There's been speculation that I was involved in the events
that occurred on the freeway and the rooftop.</i>

00:21.770 --> 00:25.150
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Stark, but do you
honestly expect us to believe that</i>

00:25.210 --> 00:27.230
<i>that was  bodyguard
in a suit</i>

00:27.290 --> 00:31.110
<i> that conveniently appeared,
despite the fact that you historically despise bodyguards?</i>

00:31.150 --> 00:32.659
<i> Yes.</i>

00:32.720 --> 00:35.280
<i>And this mysterious bodyguard was...</i>

00:35.330 --> 00:38.180
<i>...somehow equipped with...</i>

00:38.180 --> 00:40.740
<i>...an undisclosed Stark high-tech
powered battle suit?</i>

00:40.740 --> 00:43.280
<i> I know that it's confusing.</i>

00:43.310 --> 00:45.900
<i>It is one thing
to question the official story</i>

00:45.940 --> 00:50.460
<i> and another thing entirely to make wild accusations
or insinuate that I'm a superhero.</i>

00:52.760 --> 00:56.410
<i>I mean, let's face it I'm not,
the heroic type.</i>

00:57.100 --> 00:59.800
<i> I've a laundry list of character defects,
all the mistakes that I've made...</i>

00:59.800 --> 01:01.860
<i>largely public.</i>

01:01.910 --> 01:03.390
<i> The truth is...</i>

01:08.020 --> 01:09.860
<i> ...I am Iron Man.</i>

01:14.660 --> 01:15.960
Ivan ...

01:20.510 --> 01:21.870
Ivan?

01:49.340 --> 01:50.860
That should be you.

01:51.040 --> 01:53.540
Do not listen to these morons.

01:55.720 --> 01:57.630
I'm sorry.

01:58.690 --> 02:02.850
I can only offer you
my knowledge.

04:24.050 --> 04:27.540
<i> Iron Man stabilizes East-West relations</i>

05:04.400 --> 05:07.950
<i> 7-0 at 30 knots.
Holding steady at 15000 feet.</i>

05:07.950 --> 05:10.910
<i>You are clear for exfiltration
over the drop zone.</i>

05:11.580 --> 05:15.240
Six months later

07:10.600 --> 07:12.460
It's good to be back!

07:14.100 --> 07:15.340
You missed me.

07:15.340 --> 07:18.240
- Blow something up!
- Blow something up?

07:18.260 --> 07:19.800
I already did that.

07:20.380 --> 07:24.020
I'm not saying that the world is enjoying...

07:24.020 --> 07:26.510
...its longest period of
uninterrupted peace in years...

07:26.520 --> 07:28.110
because of me.

07:30.990 --> 07:33.010
I'm not saying...

07:33.600 --> 07:36.950
...that from the ashes of captivity...

07:37.190 --> 07:41.500
...never has a greater Phoenix metaphor
been personified in human history.

07:44.700 --> 07:46.380
I'm not saying...

07:46.530 --> 07:50.640
...that Uncle Sam can kick back
on a lawn chair,...

07:50.640 --> 07:52.670
...sipping on iced tea,...

07:52.730 --> 07:55.480
...because I haven't come across anyone
who's man enough...

07:55.480 --> 07:58.460
...to go toe to toe with me
on my best day!

08:02.830 --> 08:06.050
- I love you Tony!
- Please. It's not about me.

08:07.580 --> 08:09.940
It's not about you.

08:11.670 --> 08:14.740
It's not even about us.
It's about legacy.

08:15.650 --> 08:18.590
It's about what we choose to leave behind
for future generations.

08:18.590 --> 08:20.760
And that's why for the next year...

08:20.780 --> 08:22.850
and for the first time since 1974,...

08:22.850 --> 08:24.930
...the best and brightest men and women

08:24.930 --> 08:27.330
...of nations and corporations the world over...

08:27.330 --> 08:30.810
will pool their resources
share their collective vision,

08:30.810 --> 08:33.980
to leave behind
a brighter future.

08:34.070 --> 08:35.750
It's not about us!

08:36.650 --> 08:39.830
Therefore, what I am saying,
if I'm saying anything,

08:39.830 --> 08:42.740
...is welcome back to the Stark Expo!

08:46.420 --> 08:49.950
Now, making a special guest appearance
from the great beyond,

08:49.960 --> 08:51.370
to tell you what it's all about,

08:51.580 --> 08:54.460
please welcome my father, Howard.

08:56.370 --> 08:59.170
<i>Everything is achievable through technology.</i>

08:59.180 --> 09:01.990
<i> Better living.
Robust health.</i>

09:01.990 --> 09:04.470
<i> And for the first time in human history,</i>

09:04.600 --> 09:06.560
<i> the possibility of world peace.</i>

09:06.560 --> 09:10.820
<i> So from all of us here at Stark Industries,
I would like to personally introduce you to</i>

09:10.820 --> 09:13.140
<i> The city of the future.</i>

09:13.770 --> 09:17.130
<i> technology holds infinite possibilities
for mankind.</i>

09:17.130 --> 09:18.560
Blood toxicity 19%

09:20.280 --> 09:23.990
<i> soon, technology will affect
the way you live your life every day.</i>

09:24.000 --> 09:25.880
<i> No more tedious work,</i>

09:25.980 --> 09:28.490
<i> leaving more time,
leisure activities</i>

09:28.740 --> 09:30.450
<i> and enjoying sweet life.</i>

09:30.540 --> 09:33.510
<i>The Stark Expo.
Welcome.</i>

09:38.630 --> 09:40.700
We are coming to you live from the kick-off
of the Stark Expo

09:40.720 --> 09:44.190
where Tony Stark
has just walked onstage.

09:44.200 --> 09:46.250
Don't worry if you can't make it down here now,

09:46.280 --> 09:48.340
because this expo goes on all year long.

09:48.340 --> 09:50.520
And I'm gonna be here checking out
all the attractions

09:50.530 --> 09:54.490
and the pavillions and the inventions
from all around the world.

09:54.840 --> 09:56.340
It's a zoo out there, watch out alright.

09:56.350 --> 09:58.150
Open up. Let's go.

09:58.320 --> 10:00.510
Nice to see you, alright.

10:00.520 --> 10:02.010
Thank you.
I remember you.

10:03.950 --> 10:05.500
- Call me.
- Hey, come on ...

10:05.920 --> 10:06.880
Hi there, dear friend.

10:06.880 --> 10:09.100
It'll be a pleasure.

10:09.430 --> 10:12.100
- See ya buddy.
- This is Larry.

10:12.100 --> 10:14.820
The oracle of goracle.
What a pleasure, nice to see you.

10:14.820 --> 10:16.280
Call me.

10:16.280 --> 10:17.470
- Larry King.
- Larry!

10:18.060 --> 10:20.520
Yes, my people, my people.

10:20.520 --> 10:23.390
- Did it go pretty mellow?
- It wasn't so bad.

10:23.390 --> 10:25.290
- No, it's perfect.

10:25.390 --> 10:27.320
Look what we got here,
the new model.

10:27.550 --> 10:29.160
- Hey, does she come with the car?
- I certainly hope so.

10:29.160 --> 10:30.480
Hi. And you are?

10:30.480 --> 10:32.540
- Marshall. - Irish. I like it.
- Pleased to meet you Tony

10:32.540 --> 10:34.470
I'm on the wheel, you mind?

10:34.840 --> 10:36.080
- Where you from?
- Bedford.

10:36.080 --> 10:37.480
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for you.

10:37.540 --> 10:40.080
Yeah? You found me.

10:40.860 --> 10:43.610
- What are you up to later?
- Serving subpoenas.

10:44.330 --> 10:46.510
Yikes.

10:46.690 --> 10:49.410
- He doesn't like to be handed things.
- Yeah I have a peeve.

10:49.410 --> 10:52.950
You are hereby ordered to appear before
the Senate Armed Services Committee

10:52.950 --> 10:54.560
tomorrow morning at 9 am.

10:54.560 --> 10:57.580
- Can I see a badge? - You wanna see the badge?
- He likes the badge.

10:58.700 --> 11:00.920
- You still like it?
- Yup.

11:02.830 --> 11:05.140
- How far are we from D.C.?
- D.C.?

11:05.230 --> 11:06.860
250 miles.

11:08.980 --> 11:12.910
Mr. Stark, can we pick up now
where we left off?

11:12.950 --> 11:14.420
Mr. Stark?

11:14.700 --> 11:15.860
- Please.
- Yes, dear?

11:15.860 --> 11:17.650
- Can I have your attention?
- Absolutely.

11:17.650 --> 11:20.920
Do you or do you not possess a specialized weapon?

11:20.920 --> 11:22.790
- I do not.
- You do not?

11:22.790 --> 11:26.810
- I do not, well it depends how you define
the word weapon. - The Iron Man weapon.

11:26.810 --> 11:28.910
My device does not fit
that description.

11:28.920 --> 11:33.480
- Well, how would you describe your..?
- I would describe it by defining it as what it is, sir.

11:33.890 --> 11:37.320
- As?
- It's a high-tech prosthesis.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.080
That is, that's actually the most apt description
I could make of it.

11:41.080 --> 11:46.220
- It's a weapon Mr Stark I hate to inform you it's a weapon.
- Please, if your priority was actually the well-being...

11:46.370 --> 11:51.070
My priority is to get the Iron Man weapon
turned over to the people of the United States of America.

11:51.080 --> 11:52.740
Well, you can forget it.

11:52.850 --> 11:56.910
I am Iron Man.
The suit and I are one.

11:56.910 --> 12:00.050
To turn over the Iron Man suit would be
to turn over myself, which is tantamount to

12:00.150 --> 12:01.880
indentured servitude or prostitution

12:02.030 --> 12:04.050
depending on what state you're in.

12:04.120 --> 12:07.370
- I can't have it.
- Look, I am no expert.

12:07.370 --> 12:09.790
In prostitution? Of course not,
you're a senator, come on!

12:12.160 --> 12:14.430
I'm not an expert in weapons.

12:14.500 --> 12:18.320
But we have somebody here who is an expert
on weapons. I would now like to call Justin Hammer

12:18.330 --> 12:21.900
Our current primary weapons contractor.

12:21.940 --> 12:25.870
Let the record reflect that I observe
Mr. Hammer entering the chamber

12:25.870 --> 12:27.210
and I am wondering...

12:27.210 --> 12:32.360
if and when any
actual expert will also be in attendance.

12:35.100 --> 12:37.390
Absolutely. I am no expert.

12:37.390 --> 12:39.370
I defer to you, Anthony.

12:39.370 --> 12:39.400
You're the wonder boy.
I defer to you, Anthony.

12:39.400 --> 12:41.250
You're the wonder boy.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.100
Senator, if I may...

12:43.290 --> 12:47.820
I may well not be an expert,
but you know who was the expert?

12:47.880 --> 12:49.560
Your dad!

12:49.640 --> 12:52.860
Howard Stark.
Really a father to us all.

12:52.880 --> 12:55.570
and to the millitary-industrial age.

12:55.780 --> 12:59.910
Let's just be clear, he was no flower child.
He was a lion.

13:00.510 --> 13:01.560
We all know why we are here:

13:01.560 --> 13:03.430
In the last six months,

13:03.440 --> 13:07.290
Anthony Stark has created
a sword with untold possibilities.

13:07.430 --> 13:10.160
And yet I insists it's a shield.

13:10.440 --> 13:12.830
He asks us to trust him

13:12.840 --> 13:14.810
as we cower behind it.

13:15.100 --> 13:18.150
I wish I were comforted, Anthony.
I really do.

13:18.480 --> 13:21.250
I'd like to leave my door unlocked
when I leave the house,

13:21.290 --> 13:22.920
but this ain't Canada.

13:22.960 --> 13:24.590
You know we live in a world
of grave threats,

13:24.630 --> 13:28.760
threats that Mr. Stark
will not always be able to foresee.

13:29.370 --> 13:33.330
Thank you. God bless
Iron Man, God bless America.

13:35.290 --> 13:37.260
Well said, Mr. Hammer.

13:37.430 --> 13:39.980
The committee would now like to invite

13:40.040 --> 13:42.450
Lieut. Col. James Rhodes to the chamber.

13:42.450 --> 13:43.850
Rhodey?

13:49.960 --> 13:53.490
Hey, buddy. Didn't expect
to see you here.

13:53.500 --> 13:57.220
Look, it's me. I'm here. Deal with it.
Let's move on.

13:57.280 --> 13:58.770
- I just ...
- Drop it. - Alright, I'll drop it.

13:58.830 --> 14:02.380
I have before me a complete report on
the Iron Man weapon

14:02.480 --> 14:04.040
compiled by Colonel Rhodes.

14:04.040 --> 14:08.750
and Colonel, for the record,
can you please read page 57, paragraph 4?

14:08.750 --> 14:11.590
You're requesting that I read specific selections
from my report, senator?

14:11.600 --> 14:12.260
Yes, sir.

14:12.260 --> 14:16.670
My understanding that I was going to be
testifying in a much more comprehensive and detailed manner.

14:16.670 --> 14:18.490
I understand, a lot of things have changed today.

14:18.490 --> 14:22.320
You do understand that reading a single paragraph out of
context does not reflect the summary of my finding?

14:22.320 --> 14:25.100
Just read it, Colonel. I do. Thank you.

14:26.570 --> 14:27.880
Very well.

14:29.510 --> 14:33.270
As he does not operate within any
definable branch of government,

14:35.130 --> 14:39.120
The Iron Man presents a potential threat
to the security of both the nation

14:39.400 --> 14:40.720
and to her interests.

14:40.950 --> 14:45.740
I did, however, go on to summarize that the benefits
of Iron Man far outweigh the liabilities

14:45.800 --> 14:47.440
and that it would be in our interest

14:47.470 --> 14:50.570
to fold Mr Stark into the existing
chain of command.

14:50.570 --> 14:54.140
I'm not a joiner but I'll consider Secretary of
Defense, if you ask nice.

14:54.400 --> 14:56.220
We can amend the hours a little bit.

14:57.480 --> 15:01.590
I'd like to go on and show, if I may,
the imagery that's connected to your report.

15:01.600 --> 15:06.400
I believe it is somewhat premature to reveal
these images to the general public at this time.

15:06.490 --> 15:09.620
With all due respect, Colonel, I understand.
And if you could just narrate those for us,

15:09.730 --> 15:11.500
we'd be very grateful.

15:12.200 --> 15:13.430
Show the images.

15:15.460 --> 15:18.530
Intelligence suggests that the
devices seen in these photos

15:18.530 --> 15:21.100
are in fact attempts at making manned copies

15:21.130 --> 15:23.240
of Mr. Stark's suit.

15:23.240 --> 15:26.320
This has been corroborated by our allies

15:26.370 --> 15:28.060
and local intelligence on the ground

15:28.060 --> 15:30.480
indicating that these suits are

15:30.560 --> 15:33.510
quite possibly at this moment operational.

15:33.930 --> 15:35.640
Hold on a second buddy, let me see.

15:36.640 --> 15:38.920
There's something here.
Oh, boy I'm good.

15:38.930 --> 15:40.900
Now can I get more screens.

15:41.820 --> 15:44.820
I need them.
Time for a little transparency.

15:44.870 --> 15:46.720
- Let's see what's really going on.
- What is he doing?

15:46.720 --> 15:49.320
If you'll direct your attention to said screens,

15:49.330 --> 15:51.930
I believe that's North Korea.

16:00.970 --> 16:02.770
Can you turn that off? Take it off.

16:02.770 --> 16:04.790
Iran.

16:07.300 --> 16:10.170
No grave, immediate threat here.

16:10.220 --> 16:12.150
Is that Justin Hammer?

16:12.300 --> 16:14.840
How did Hammer get in here?

16:14.840 --> 16:16.810
Justin, you're on TV, focus up.

16:28.260 --> 16:32.510
Wow. Yeah, I'd say most countries, 5-10 years away.

16:32.590 --> 16:36.610
- Hammer Industries 20.
- I'd like to point out that that test pilot survived.

16:36.610 --> 16:39.860
I think we got the point that he's making.
I don't think there's any reason...

16:39.950 --> 16:41.530
The point is you're welcome, I guess.

16:41.530 --> 16:44.130
- For what?
- Because, I'm your nuclear deterrent.

16:44.440 --> 16:46.710
It's working. We're safe.
America is secure.

16:46.740 --> 16:48.900
You want my property?
You can't have it!

16:48.900 --> 16:51.090
But did I you a big favor.

16:51.090 --> 16:53.770
I've successfully privatized world peace.

16:56.880 --> 16:58.320
What more do you want?

16:58.760 --> 17:00.090
For now!

17:00.710 --> 17:03.540
I'm tired of all of these ass clowns!

17:04.010 --> 17:06.540
Fuck you Mr Stark.
Fuck you buddy.

17:07.089 --> 17:09.390
- We're adjourned, we're adjourned for today.
- Okay

17:09.730 --> 17:11.470
You've been a delight.

17:17.040 --> 17:19.030
<i> My bond is with the people.</i>

17:19.230 --> 17:21.280
<i> And I will serve this great nation</i>

17:21.310 --> 17:25.000
<i> at the pleasure of myself.</i>

17:25.310 --> 17:28.319
<i> One thing I've proven
is that you can count on me ...</i>

17:28.650 --> 17:29.930
<i> ...to pleasure myself.</i>

18:05.440 --> 18:08.520
- Wake up, daddy's home.
- Welcome home, sir.

18:08.610 --> 18:11.280
Congratulations on the opening ceremonies.
They were such a success.

18:11.320 --> 18:13.380
as was your Senate hearing.

18:13.740 --> 18:18.470
And may I say how refreshing it is to finally
see you in a video with your clothing on, sir?

18:21.510 --> 18:22.830
You!

18:23.380 --> 18:26.900
I swear to god I'll dismantle you, I'll switch
your motherboard and turn you into wine rack.

18:28.730 --> 18:31.840
How many ounces a day of this gargle
am I supposed to drink?

18:31.840 --> 18:35.530
We are up to 80 ounces a day
to counteract the symptoms, sir.

18:36.990 --> 18:38.770
Check palladium levels.

18:40.950 --> 18:43.520
Blood toxicity: 24%

18:44.610 --> 18:48.940
It appears that the continued use of the
Iron Man suit is accelerating your condition.

18:51.040 --> 18:53.130
Another core has been depleted.

18:56.890 --> 18:58.400
God, they're running out quick.

18:58.640 --> 19:01.120
I have run simulations
on every known element

19:01.120 --> 19:04.730
and none can serve as a viable replacement for
the palladium core.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.930
You are running out of both time
and options.

19:14.520 --> 19:18.420
Unfortunately, the device
that's keeping you alive, is also killing you.

19:20.440 --> 19:23.390
Ms. Potts is approaching.
I recommended that you inform her of...

19:23.390 --> 19:24.670
Mute.

19:28.090 --> 19:29.380
Is this a joke?

19:31.020 --> 19:32.240
What are you thinking?

19:32.270 --> 19:33.880
- What?
- What are you thinking?

19:33.930 --> 19:37.080
Hey, I'm thinking I'm busy
and you're angry about something.

19:37.570 --> 19:38.990
Do you have the sniffles? I don't wanna get sick.
Keep your distance

19:38.990 --> 19:43.670
Did you just donate our entire
modern art collection to the...

19:44.160 --> 19:46.030
- Boy Scouts of America?
- Yes it is a...

19:46.030 --> 19:47.810
worthwhile organization.

19:47.810 --> 19:51.170
I didn't physically check the crates,
but basically yes.

19:51.170 --> 19:53.410
And it's not our collection, it's my collection. No offense.

19:53.510 --> 19:57.150
No, you know what I think I'm actually entitled to say
Our collection,

19:57.150 --> 20:01.360
considering the time that I've put in
over 10 years curating that.

20:01.360 --> 20:02.600
It's a tax write-off, I needed that.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.870
You know, there's only about 8,011 things

20:04.900 --> 20:07.690
that I really need to talk to you about.

20:07.690 --> 20:10.740
Dummy, hey stop now the bridgeport's already
machining that part.

20:10.770 --> 20:13.070
The expo is a gigantic waste of time.

20:13.130 --> 20:16.780
- I need you to wear a surgical mask until
you're feeling better is that okay? - That's rude.

20:16.780 --> 20:18.420
There's nothing more important to me than the Expo.

20:18.450 --> 20:19.900
It's my primary point of concern. I don't know why you...

20:19.900 --> 20:23.220
The Expo is your ego gone crazy.

20:23.370 --> 20:24.900
Wow, look at that.

20:25.920 --> 20:28.870
That's modern art.
That's going up.

20:28.890 --> 20:30.690
- You've got to be kidding me.
- I'm gonna put this up right now.

20:31.250 --> 20:34.020
Stark is in complete disarray. Do you understand that?

20:34.070 --> 20:36.170
No, our stocks have never been higher...

20:36.170 --> 20:40.510
- Yes from a managerial standpoint. - Well if it's messy,
then let's double back. Let's move on to another subject.

20:40.510 --> 20:44.390
Oh, no no no, you are not taking down the
Barnett Newman and hanging that up!

20:44.390 --> 20:46.990
I'm not taking it down, I'm just replacing it
with this, let's see where I can get...

20:47.090 --> 20:48.620
Ok fine. My point is

20:48.660 --> 20:52.210
We have already awarded contracts
to the windfarm people,

20:52.210 --> 20:54.010
Don't say windfarm, I'm already feeling gassy.

20:54.020 --> 20:55.940
And to the Plastic Plantation Tree,
which was your idea by the way.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.860
- Those people are on payroll, and you won't
make a decision. - Everything was my idea,

20:58.890 --> 21:00.710
I don't care about the liberal agenda anymore.

21:00.710 --> 21:03.090
It's boring, boring!
I'm giving you a boring order,

21:03.090 --> 21:04.270
you do it.

21:04.340 --> 21:05.620
I do what?

21:05.620 --> 21:08.120
Excellent idea, I just figured this out.
You run the company.

21:08.530 --> 21:10.600
- Yeah, i'm trying to run the company.
- Pepper, I need you to run the company.

21:10.620 --> 21:14.670
- Well stop trying to do it and do it.
- You will not give me the information that I need

21:14.670 --> 21:17.050
- I need you to do it.
- I am trying to do it but...

21:17.050 --> 21:20.010
You're not listening to me. I'm trying to make you CEO.

21:20.050 --> 21:21.890
Why won't you let me?

21:22.620 --> 21:24.130
Have you been drinking?

21:24.780 --> 21:26.140
Uh, chlorophyl.

21:27.480 --> 21:30.390
I hereby irrevocably appoint you

21:30.400 --> 21:33.100
Chairman and CEO
of Stark Industries effective immediately.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.380
Yeah, done deal.

21:39.460 --> 21:41.990
Actually, I've given this a fair amount of thought.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.080
believe it or not. Been doing a bit of
a headhunting so to speak...

21:46.150 --> 21:49.280
trying to figure out who
a worthy successor would be.

21:49.990 --> 21:51.620
And then I realized ...

21:54.410 --> 21:57.140
it's you.
It's always been you.

21:58.910 --> 22:00.630
I thought there'd be a legal issue,
but actually

22:00.680 --> 22:03.340
I'm capable of appointing my successor,

22:04.190 --> 22:06.010
my successor being you.

22:08.600 --> 22:10.090
Congratulations!

22:11.630 --> 22:12.710
Take it, just take it.

22:12.710 --> 22:14.750
- I don't know what to think.
- Don't think, drink.

23:02.700 --> 23:06.100
Notary is here! Can you please come
sign the transfer paperworks?

23:06.110 --> 23:07.410
I'm on Happy's count!

23:14.250 --> 23:15.310
- Sorry.
- What the hell was that?

23:15.310 --> 23:17.320
It's called mixed martial arts.
It's been around for three weeks.

23:17.400 --> 23:20.030
It's called dirty boxing.
There's nothing new about it.

23:25.380 --> 23:29.500
I promise you this is the only time
I will ask you to sign over your company.

23:31.440 --> 23:33.420
I need you to initial each box.

23:34.340 --> 23:36.540
Lesson one:
Never take your eye off...

23:39.330 --> 23:40.490
That's it I'm done.

23:40.490 --> 23:42.720
- What's your name, lady?
- Rushman, Natalie Rushman.

23:42.720 --> 23:44.440
Front and center, come in to the church.

23:44.440 --> 23:48.340
- No, you're seriously not gonna...
- If it pleases the Court, which it does.

23:48.340 --> 23:51.630
- No problem.
- I'm sorry. He's very eccentric.

24:05.370 --> 24:06.540
What?

24:10.530 --> 24:12.560
- Can you give her a lesson?
- No problem.

24:14.580 --> 24:15.650
What?

24:16.450 --> 24:17.630
Who is she?

24:17.630 --> 24:20.270
She is from legal and she is potentially

24:20.270 --> 24:23.740
a very expensive sexual harassment lawsuit

24:23.740 --> 24:26.000
- if you keep ogling her like that.
- I need an assistant boxer. I need an assistant.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.620
Yes, and I have three excellent potential candidates
that are lined up and ready to beat you.

24:29.620 --> 24:33.870
- I don't have time to meet. I need someone now
I feel like it's her. - No it's not.

24:34.210 --> 24:35.670
- You ever boxed before?
- I have, yes.

24:35.680 --> 24:38.930
Like Tae Bo, booty boot camp, crunch,
something like that?

24:39.840 --> 24:43.490
- How do we spell your name Natalie?
- R-U-S-H-M-A-N.

24:43.500 --> 24:46.800
- What are you gonna google her now?
- I thought I was ogling her.

24:47.920 --> 24:51.930
- Oh wow. Very, very impressive individual...
- You're so predictable, you know that?

24:51.930 --> 24:53.780
she's fluent in French,
Italian, Russian, Latin...

24:53.810 --> 24:55.030
Who speaks Latin?

24:55.040 --> 24:57.440
No one speaks Latin. It's a dead language.

24:58.600 --> 25:01.950
You can read Latin or you can write, but you can't
speak Latin so...

25:01.950 --> 25:04.170
- Did you model in Tokyo?
Cause she modelled in Tokyo. - No.

25:04.240 --> 25:05.620
I need her, she's got everything that I need.

25:05.620 --> 25:07.950
Rule number one: Never take your eye off
your opponent.

25:10.210 --> 25:11.970
Oh my God!

25:14.040 --> 25:16.600
- Happy!
- That's what I'm talking about.

25:16.610 --> 25:18.780
- I slipped.
- You did?

25:18.810 --> 25:20.560
Looks like a TKO to me.

25:23.640 --> 25:27.890
- Just, um, I need your impression.
- You have quite reserved, I don't know...

25:27.890 --> 25:30.530
- I meant your fingerprints.
- Right.

25:33.280 --> 25:36.490
- So, how're we doing?
- Great. Just half done,... hey.

25:38.020 --> 25:39.310
You're the boss.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.070
Will that be all, Mr. Stark?

25:41.070 --> 25:42.030
- No.
- Yes.

25:42.030 --> 25:44.460
That will be all, Ms. Rushman.
Thank you very much.

25:47.990 --> 25:49.600
- I want one.
- No.

26:00.510 --> 26:03.160
Welcome to the Historic Grand Prix
of Monaco.

26:03.220 --> 26:06.290
This year's race will be exciting...

26:23.960 --> 26:27.770
It's Europe, whatever happens the next
twenty minutes just go with it.

26:27.770 --> 26:29.470
- Mr. Stark?
- Hey

26:29.540 --> 26:31.350
- How was your flight?
- It was excellent.

26:31.460 --> 26:34.770
- Oh it's nice to see you.
- We have one photographer from the ACM if you don't mind.

26:36.270 --> 26:38.430
- When did this happen?
- You made me do it.

26:38.430 --> 26:40.880
- I made you do what?
- Smile and you. Look there.

26:41.290 --> 26:42.420
Stop acting constipated.

26:42.430 --> 26:44.060
- You are so predictable.
- Do not inflate your nostrils.

26:44.060 --> 26:45.950
- Right this way.
- Thanks, you look fantastic.

26:45.960 --> 26:48.620
- Why thank you very much.
- But that's unprofessional. What's on the docket?

26:48.890 --> 26:50.610
We have a 9.30 dinner.

26:50.830 --> 26:54.210
- Perfect I'll be there at 11. Is this ours?
- It can be.

26:54.530 --> 26:55.850
Great, make it ours.

26:56.360 --> 26:58.910
Mr. Musk, how are you?

26:58.910 --> 27:00.810
- Congratulations on the promotion.
- Thank you very much.

27:00.810 --> 27:03.070
Elon, those Merlin engines
are fantastic.

27:03.070 --> 27:05.070
Thanks. I got an idea
for an electric jet.

27:05.070 --> 27:07.380
You do? Then we'll make it work.

27:08.750 --> 27:11.440
- You want a massage? - Oh god no I don't want a massage.
- I'll have Natalie make an appointment.

27:11.440 --> 27:13.480
I do not want Natalie to do anything.

27:13.480 --> 27:15.590
- By the way I didn't mean to spring this on you.
- Thank you very much.

27:15.670 --> 27:17.470
Green is not your best color.

27:17.480 --> 27:19.330
Anthony, is that you?

27:19.330 --> 27:21.850
My least favorite person on earth,
Justin Hammer. - How you doing?

27:22.140 --> 27:24.990
You're not the only rich guy here
with a fancy car.

27:25.210 --> 27:28.070
You know Christine Everhart
from Vanity Fair? You guys know each other?

27:28.080 --> 27:29.450
- Hi.
- Yes.

27:29.640 --> 27:31.260
- Yes!
- Yes, roughly.

27:31.430 --> 27:33.450
BTW, big story,

27:33.520 --> 27:35.840
The new CEO of Stark Industries.

27:36.220 --> 27:38.240
- Congratulations.
- My editor will kill me ...

27:38.250 --> 27:40.070
... if I don't grab a quote
for our Powerful Women issue.
- Oh.

27:40.120 --> 27:41.640
- Can I?
- Sure.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.790
She's actually doing a big spread on me
for Vanity Fair.

27:43.850 --> 27:46.080
- I am.
- I thought I'd throw her a bone, you know.

27:47.570 --> 27:50.930
She did quite a spread on
Tony last year.

27:50.940 --> 27:53.820
- And she wrote a story as well.
- It was very impressive.

27:53.820 --> 27:55.530
- That was good.
- Very well done.

27:56.640 --> 27:58.760
- I'm gonna go wash.
- Do not leave me.

27:58.760 --> 28:01.770
- How you doing? You look great.
- Please, this is hard.

28:03.090 --> 28:06.770
- So is this the first time that...
- Oh, god that's so awful.

28:07.670 --> 28:10.190
Listen, it's the first time you've seen each other
since the Senate?

28:10.190 --> 28:14.000
- Since he got his contract revoked.
- Actually, it's on hold.

28:14.050 --> 28:15.260
That's not what I heard.

28:15.270 --> 28:18.060
What's the difference between
on hold and canceled? The truth?

28:18.060 --> 28:20.500
No. The truth is, oh put that away,

28:20.510 --> 28:24.880
The truth is I'm actually hoping to
present something at your expo.

28:25.340 --> 28:28.170
Well, if you invent something that works,
I'll make sure I get you a slot.

28:28.260 --> 28:30.100
- Mr. Stark?
- Yes.

28:30.230 --> 28:31.730
- He's kidding,...
- Your corner table is ready.

28:31.970 --> 28:34.430
- I actually have a slot, yes I do.
- Hammer needs a 'slot.'

28:34.660 --> 28:38.680
- We'll give him. - We kid, we're kidders.

29:00.710 --> 29:02.260
Got any other bad ideas?

29:12.270 --> 29:14.500
Tony and I, Tony,
I love Tony Stark.

29:14.570 --> 29:16.470
Tony loves me.
We're not competitors.

29:16.470 --> 29:20.230
Him being out of the picture created tremendous
opportunity for Hammer Industries you know.

29:21.560 --> 29:24.130
Everything that Tony and I do is a healthy...

29:24.140 --> 29:26.940
<i>What's the use of having and owning
a race car,</i>

29:27.920 --> 29:29.240
...competition.

29:29.290 --> 29:30.610
<i> ...if you don't drive it?</i>

29:32.280 --> 29:33.790
Is he driving?

29:40.760 --> 29:42.380
Natalie! Natalie!

29:43.330 --> 29:44.640
- Yes?
- Did you know about this?

29:44.640 --> 29:46.430
This is the first time I hear it.

29:47.680 --> 29:50.220
- That cannot happen.
- Absolutely, I understand. How can I help you?

29:50.230 --> 29:51.970
- Where is Happy?
- He's waiting outside.

29:51.970 --> 29:53.440
- Ok get him, I need Happy.
- Right away.

29:54.480 --> 29:56.350
Tony is, we're, you know...

29:56.470 --> 29:58.950
We're not competitive.
You know what I mean?

29:59.320 --> 30:00.650
You know what?
Can you excuse me just one second?

30:00.680 --> 30:02.840
- Why don't you just read me what you wrote?
- I will.

30:02.880 --> 30:06.160
- After I make one quick phone call.
- Where are you going?

30:06.160 --> 30:08.780
- I got some caviar coming.
- This is great stuff, I'll be right back!

31:23.840 --> 31:26.840
<i> That asshole just goes inside the track!</i>

32:00.350 --> 32:02.300
<i> God!</i>

32:09.430 --> 32:10.650
Go, go!

32:14.210 --> 32:15.280
Hang on!

33:24.190 --> 33:26.020
- Give me the case.
- Here, take it.

33:26.680 --> 33:27.810
- Where is the key!
- It's in my pocket.

33:27.820 --> 33:29.260
Car!

34:40.750 --> 34:43.330
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

34:44.100 --> 34:46.370
- Were you heading for me or him?
- I wanted to scare him.

34:46.380 --> 34:48.460
- Cause I can't tell!
- Are you out of your mind?

34:48.460 --> 34:49.969
- Better security.
- Get in the car!

34:49.969 --> 34:51.790
- I was attacked!
- You're a jerk!

34:51.860 --> 34:52.949
- We need better security.
- Get in the car!

34:52.949 --> 34:56.290
Better security measures!
God it's embarrassing.

34:57.310 --> 34:59.090
First vacation in two years.

35:04.170 --> 35:05.460
Oh  my god!

35:07.130 --> 35:09.380
- I got him!
- Hit him again, hit him again!

35:09.530 --> 35:11.330
Give me the case.

35:13.290 --> 35:16.810
- I hit him!
- Give me the case!

35:17.450 --> 35:20.500
Give him the case!

35:26.030 --> 35:27.190
Oh, god!

35:29.310 --> 35:32.200
Give me the case! Please!
Come on!

37:04.200 --> 37:05.870
You'll lose!

37:12.130 --> 37:15.400
You'll lose. You'll lose, Stark.

37:33.310 --> 37:37.640
We've checked his fingerprints. Nothing.
Not even a name.

37:37.690 --> 37:40.080
- Where are we going?
- There.

37:40.400 --> 37:42.470
He may not understand us.

37:42.480 --> 37:45.760
In fact, he has not even spoken.

37:45.830 --> 37:47.080
Five minutes.

38:08.430 --> 38:12.010
Pretty decent tech. Cycles
per second were a little low.

38:17.800 --> 38:19.590
You could double up your rotations,

38:23.510 --> 38:26.280
You focused the Repulsor energy
through ionized plasma channels.

38:26.330 --> 38:28.150
Effective.

38:28.380 --> 38:31.880
Not very efficient.
But it's passable enough though.

38:33.440 --> 38:37.040
I don't get it. With a little fine tuning
you could've made a solid paycheck,

38:37.040 --> 38:39.100
if you sold it to North Korea,
China,

38:39.410 --> 38:42.680
Iran, or gone right to
the black market.

38:43.620 --> 38:45.520
You look like you got friends in low places.

38:46.700 --> 38:48.610
You come from a

38:48.990 --> 38:52.260
family of thieves and butchers.

38:53.580 --> 38:55.990
And now,
like all guilty men,

38:56.890 --> 38:59.320
try to rewrite your
own history

39:00.150 --> 39:02.810
and you forget all the lives

39:02.860 --> 39:05.110
that Stark family has destroyed.

39:06.200 --> 39:08.510
Speaking of thieves,
where did you get this design?

39:09.630 --> 39:12.910
My father.
Anton Vanko.

39:13.790 --> 39:15.170
Well I've never heard of him.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.670
My father is the reason you're alive.

39:20.090 --> 39:22.980
The reason I'm alive is cause you had a shot,
you took it and you missed.

39:23.770 --> 39:25.010
Did I?

39:27.790 --> 39:30.050
If you can make god bleed

39:30.920 --> 39:33.140
people will cease to believe him.

39:35.130 --> 39:37.740
And there will be blood in the water.

39:37.740 --> 39:39.640
and the sharks will come.

39:41.440 --> 39:44.930
The truth, all they have to do is sit and watch

39:45.920 --> 39:48.280
as the world will consume you.

39:48.630 --> 39:50.770
Where will you be watching the world
consume me from?

39:50.820 --> 39:52.120
That's right.

39:52.170 --> 39:54.280
A prison cell.
I'll send you a bar of soap.

39:54.710 --> 39:56.980
Hey Tony, before you go,

39:56.990 --> 40:00.780
palladium in the chest,
painful way to die.

40:17.850 --> 40:21.440
<i> It's just unbelievable it proves
the genie is out of the bottle</i>

40:21.440 --> 40:23.880
<i> and this man
has no idea what he's doing</i>

40:23.880 --> 40:27.790
<i> He thinks of the Iron Man
weapon as a toy.</i>

40:27.960 --> 40:32.640
<i> I was at a hearing where
Mr. Stark in fact was adamant</i>

40:32.780 --> 40:36.250
<i> that these suits can't exist,</i>

40:36.330 --> 40:38.860
<i> anywhere else, don't exist anywhere else,
never will exist anywhere else</i>

40:38.860 --> 40:42.240
<i> at least for 5-10 years
and here we are in Monaco</i>

40:42.240 --> 40:45.050
<i> realizing, uh-oh, these suits exist now</i>

40:45.050 --> 40:48.180
Mute.

40:48.180 --> 40:50.270
He should be giving me a medal.

40:50.270 --> 40:52.510
That's the truth.

40:55.480 --> 40:57.570
What is that?

40:57.570 --> 41:00.850
This is your in-flight meal.

41:02.260 --> 41:04.870
- Did you just make that?
- Yeah.

41:04.870 --> 41:08.150
Where do you think I've been for three hours?

41:09.040 --> 41:11.280
Tony ...

41:12.590 --> 41:15.870
What are you not telling me?

41:18.850 --> 41:21.980
I don't want to go home ...

41:21.980 --> 41:24.060
at all.

41:24.060 --> 41:27.190
Let's cancel
my birthday party and

41:27.190 --> 41:29.590
We're in Europe.
Let's go to Venice, Chipriani.

41:29.700 --> 41:31.780
- Remember?
- Oh yes.

41:31.780 --> 41:34.390
It's a great place to...

41:34.390 --> 41:35.430
be healthy.

41:35.430 --> 41:38.560
I don't think this is the right time.

41:38.560 --> 41:40.650
We are in a kind of a mess.

41:40.650 --> 41:42.890
Yeah but maybe that's why it's the best time.

41:43.180 --> 41:45.220
Wow, I think as the CEO I need to

41:45.220 --> 41:48.510
show up. - As CEO
you are entitled to a

41:49.390 --> 41:51.510
- leave?
- Company retreat.

41:51.510 --> 41:53.560
A retreat? During a time like this?

41:53.560 --> 41:56.860
I'm just saying to recharge our batteries
and figure it all out.

41:57.320 --> 42:01.030
Not everybody runs on batteries, Tony.

42:33.890 --> 42:36.140
<i>Have fun with the Püree</i>

43:27.350 --> 43:29.980
Prisoner stop!

43:29.980 --> 43:32.520
What are you doing?

44:12.510 --> 44:15.550
Hey, here he is!

44:15.550 --> 44:18.600
There he is!

44:18.910 --> 44:20.950
What an absolute pleasure.

44:20.950 --> 44:22.910
Welcome.

44:22.910 --> 44:27.600
Goodness gracious, can we get the handcuffs
off my friend here?

44:27.700 --> 44:29.700
Forgive me, I'm sorry.

44:29.700 --> 44:31.690
I'm such a huge fan of yours.

44:31.690 --> 44:33.660
I didn't wanna...

44:33.660 --> 44:35.170
make a first impression like this.

44:35.170 --> 44:35.280
He's not an animal. Come on.
make a first impression like this.

44:35.280 --> 44:37.830
He's not an animal. Come on.

44:37.830 --> 44:39.970
He's a human being.

44:39.970 --> 44:42.740
Thank you.

44:43.160 --> 44:45.350
Leave us.

44:46.210 --> 44:48.620
Oui, oui, I'm fine.

44:49.250 --> 44:51.280
My name is Justin Hammer.

44:51.280 --> 44:53.290
I'd like to do some business with you.

44:53.290 --> 44:55.370
Please sit.

44:58.250 --> 45:01.250
Dig in.
What do we have today, Jack?

45:01.250 --> 45:02.600
Some salmon carpaccio, sir.

45:02.610 --> 45:04.380
Salmon carpaccio?

45:05.610 --> 45:07.820
Anything you want here, we got it.

45:07.820 --> 45:09.820
I like my dessert first.

45:09.820 --> 45:11.760
I had this flown in from
San Francisco.

45:11.760 --> 45:13.740
It's Italian though.

45:13.740 --> 45:15.650
Organic ice cream.

45:15.650 --> 45:18.650
I got a sweet tooth.
Apparently you do too

45:18.650 --> 45:20.990
for Tony Stark.

45:21.070 --> 45:23.670
When I saw what you do to
Tony Stark on that track

45:23.670 --> 45:27.610
how you stepped up to him in front of
god and everybody,

45:27.820 --> 45:29.820
that was wow!

45:29.830 --> 45:31.860
You spoke to me was what you did.

45:31.860 --> 45:33.830
And I know that you knew that
I'd be listening.

45:34.350 --> 45:37.350
This is why I couldn't bear to have you shipped off
to god knows where.

45:37.350 --> 45:39.350
It would've been such a waste of talent.

45:39.350 --> 45:41.350
But if I might make a suggestion you know
you don't just go

45:41.350 --> 45:44.350
and try to kill the guy. I think...

45:44.350 --> 45:46.400
if I may,

45:46.400 --> 45:48.430
you go after his legacy.

45:48.440 --> 45:50.400
That's what you should kill.

45:50.400 --> 45:53.440
You and me we're a lot alike in a lot of ways.

45:53.450 --> 45:56.400
The only difference between you and I

45:56.400 --> 45:58.850
is that I have resources.

45:58.850 --> 46:01.410
I think, if I may,

46:01.410 --> 46:03.420
you need my resources.

46:03.420 --> 46:05.360
Someone behind you.

46:05.370 --> 46:08.490
A benefactor.
I'd like to be that guy.

46:19.850 --> 46:21.850
Okay.
Do you speak English,

46:21.850 --> 46:24.850
because I can get a translator.

46:24.850 --> 46:27.300
I don't know if you've been understanding
everything I'm saying.

46:27.300 --> 46:29.900
- Very good, man.
- Very good, man.

46:29.900 --> 46:33.020
Very good, man.

46:35.900 --> 46:39.070
- Yes.
- I want my bird.

46:39.900 --> 46:41.900
A bird?

46:41.910 --> 46:43.940
- You want a bird?
- I want my bird.

46:43.940 --> 46:45.940
I can get you bird
I can get you ten birds.

46:45.940 --> 46:47.900
- I want my bird.
- Okay,

46:47.900 --> 46:49.860
nothing's impossible.

46:49.870 --> 46:53.510
I could, are we talking about...
is this a bird back in Russia?

46:53.830 --> 46:56.990
Yes, but the fundamentals of the company
are still very, very strong.

46:57.830 --> 47:00.830
despite the events in Monaco.

47:00.830 --> 47:02.870
Oh, oh, fax them.

47:02.870 --> 47:04.910
- Where is he?
- He doesn't wanna be disturbed.

47:04.910 --> 47:07.870
He's downstairs.

47:07.880 --> 47:09.880
<i>His continuing erratic behavior</i>

47:09.880 --> 47:12.230
<i>may lead many people to ask themselves</i>

47:12.230 --> 47:14.260
<i>can this man still protect us?</i>

47:14.340 --> 47:15.960
Iron Man never stopped protecting us.

47:15.960 --> 47:18.880
The events in Monaco prove that.

47:18.880 --> 47:20.880
<i>Query complete, sir.</i>

47:20.880 --> 47:23.350
<i>Anton Vanko was
a Soviet physicist</i>

47:23.350 --> 47:26.610
<i>who defected to the United States
in 1963.</i>

47:26.610 --> 47:28.890
<i> However, he was accused of espionage
and was</i>

47:28.890 --> 47:30.890
<i>deported in 1967.</i>

47:30.890 --> 47:32.890
<i>His son, Ivan, who is also a physicist,</i>

47:32.890 --> 47:36.890
<i>was convicted of selling
Soviet-era weapons-grade plutonium</i>

47:36.890 --> 47:40.850
<i>to Pakistan and served 15 years
in Kopeisk prison.</i>

47:40.850 --> 47:44.010
<i>No further records exist.</i>

47:46.850 --> 47:50.850
Tony, you gotta get upstair
and get on top of this situation right now.

47:50.850 --> 47:54.770
Listen, I've been on the phone with the
National Guard

47:54.770 --> 47:56.500
all day

47:56.500 --> 47:59.220
trying to talk them out of rolling tanks and the PCH

47:59.220 --> 48:01.730
knocking down your front door
and taking these.

48:01.730 --> 48:03.770
They're gonna take your suits, Tony,

48:03.770 --> 48:05.730
they're sick of the games.

48:05.730 --> 48:08.730
You said nobody else would possess this technology
for twenty years.

48:08.730 --> 48:11.690
Well guess what,
somebody else had it yesterday.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.900
It's not theoretical anymore.

48:15.740 --> 48:18.860
Are you listening to me?

48:19.690 --> 48:22.700
Are you okay?

48:22.700 --> 48:25.860
Let's go.

48:30.700 --> 48:33.870
- Are you alright?
- Yeah I should go to my desk.

48:33.950 --> 48:36.940
- See that cigar box?
- Yes.

48:36.950 --> 48:40.160
It's palladium.

48:44.990 --> 48:46.990
Is that supposed to be smoking?

48:47.000 --> 48:49.030
If you must know
it's neutron damage.

48:49.030 --> 48:52.120
it's from that reactor wall.

48:54.960 --> 48:58.170
You had this
in your body?

49:01.960 --> 49:05.130
And how about the high-tech
crossword puzzle on your neck?

49:05.960 --> 49:09.130
Rogue rash.

49:10.970 --> 49:13.090
Thank you.

49:24.060 --> 49:26.180
- What are you looking at?
- I'm looking at you.

49:27.020 --> 49:30.020
You wanna do this whole lone gunslinger act

49:30.020 --> 49:33.020
and it's unnecessary.
You don't have to do this alone.

49:33.020 --> 49:35.040
You know I wish I could believe that.
I really do.

49:35.040 --> 49:36.980
But you gotta trust me.

49:36.980 --> 49:40.150
Contrary to popular belief,
I know exactly what I'm doing.

49:49.570 --> 49:52.030
This is where we do it
This is my humble abode.

49:52.030 --> 49:53.990
You can work in absolute peace.

49:53.990 --> 49:57.110
Must be kinda fun to be dead, right
No pressure.

49:57.350 --> 49:59.990
Ah, here they are.
They're excited, they're combat ready.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.030
I may have done a few miscalculations and

50:02.030 --> 50:04.000
rushed the prototype, but sue me,

50:04.000 --> 50:07.160
I'm enthusiastic.
Go ahead, take a look around.

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
Oh, you don't wanna do that.

50:15.000 --> 50:18.010
You'll be able to access that as soon as
we generate some encrypted passcodes.

50:18.010 --> 50:21.380
Can we generate some encrypted passcodes?
Let's get some of those...

50:22.010 --> 50:23.990
encrypted passcodes, Jack.

50:25.010 --> 50:28.130
Nevermind.

50:28.970 --> 50:32.140
Wow, okay. Good stuff.

50:33.330 --> 50:36.180
- Sorry?
- Software shit.

50:41.020 --> 50:43.020
You're good.

50:43.020 --> 50:46.140
You really blasted and
passed the firewall there.

50:46.980 --> 50:50.020
Let me show you where
you're gonna be working primarily.

50:50.020 --> 50:53.030
Go ahead, take a look.

50:53.030 --> 50:55.240
Take a good look at that.
That's something, isn't it?

50:55.240 --> 50:58.190
You know they're really just for show and tell.

50:58.990 --> 51:02.200
They're 125.7 million a pop.

51:05.040 --> 51:08.040
Jeez, could you get somebody to help?

51:08.040 --> 51:10.990
That's where the pilot goes.

51:10.990 --> 51:14.160
I'm having a tough time finding volunteers.

51:15.000 --> 51:18.160
I'll take care of that just leave it.

51:18.420 --> 51:20.000
What you want them do?

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
Long term
I want them to put me in

51:22.000 --> 51:25.000
the Pentagon for the
next 25 years.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.080
I wanna make Iron Man look
like an antique.

51:27.080 --> 51:29.000
I wanna go to that Stark Expo

51:29.010 --> 51:31.060
and take a dump on Tony's front yard.

51:31.060 --> 51:33.610
- You know what I'm talking about?
- Ya I can do that.

51:33.610 --> 51:35.110
- Yes?
- No problem.

51:35.110 --> 51:37.050
Hey, fabulous
I love it.

51:37.050 --> 51:40.180
This is our guy. Didn't I tell you?
I had a feeling.

51:49.060 --> 51:52.060
Do you know which watch you'd like
to wear tonight Mr. Stark?

51:52.060 --> 51:55.190
I'll give them a look.

51:57.020 --> 51:59.060
I should cancel the party now?

51:59.060 --> 52:02.020
- Probably.
- Yeah, cause it's, um...

52:02.030 --> 52:05.030
- Ill-timed.
- Right, sends the wrong message.

52:05.030 --> 52:08.150
Inappropriate.

52:11.990 --> 52:15.030
Is that dirty enough for you?

52:15.030 --> 52:17.080
Gold faced with the brown band...

52:17.490 --> 52:20.030
The Jaeger.
I'll give that a look.

52:20.040 --> 52:23.200
Bring them over here.

52:24.040 --> 52:27.200
I'll take that.
Why don't you...

52:38.670 --> 52:41.050
I gotta say it's hard to
get a read on you.

52:41.050 --> 52:44.170
- Where are you from?
- Legal.

52:46.050 --> 52:49.170
Can I ask you a question hypothetically?
It's a bit odd.

52:50.050 --> 52:55.570
If this was your last birthday party you're ever
gonna have how would you celebrate it?

52:58.010 --> 53:00.490
I'd do whatever I wanted to do.

53:00.490 --> 53:03.220
with whoever I wanted to do it.

53:36.040 --> 53:38.040
Yes, sir, I understand.

53:38.040 --> 53:41.200
No, sir, that will not be necessary.
I'll handle it.

53:42.040 --> 53:44.210
Sir, I personally guarantee that
within 24 hours

53:44.230 --> 53:46.290
Iron Man will be
back on watch.

53:54.090 --> 53:56.090
Hey, Pepper ...

53:56.090 --> 53:59.260
- I'm gonna go get some air.
- What's wrong?

54:00.100 --> 54:03.260
- I don't know what to do.
- You gotta be kidding me.

54:08.060 --> 54:11.060
- That's it, I'm gonna make a...
- No, no, don't call anyone.

54:11.060 --> 54:13.140
This is ridiculous I just stuck my neck up
for this guy.

54:13.140 --> 54:16.060
I know. I get it. I'm gonna handle it okay,
just let me handle it.

54:16.060 --> 54:19.230
Handle it, or I'm gonna have to.

54:20.060 --> 54:23.230
You know the question I get asked most often is
Tony how do you go to the bathroom with the suit?

54:27.070 --> 54:30.230
Just like that.

54:32.490 --> 54:35.280
Does this guy know how to throw a party
or what?

54:39.120 --> 54:41.120
I love you.

54:41.120 --> 54:45.950
Unbelievable. Thank you so much
Tony, we all thank you so much for such a

54:46.120 --> 54:49.080
wonderful night. We're gonna say
Good night now

54:49.080 --> 54:51.080
and thank you all for coming.

54:51.080 --> 54:54.290
No, no, wait, we can't, we didn't bring out the cake
we didn't blow out the candle.

54:54.290 --> 54:56.080
- You're out of control okay
- I'm out of control?

54:56.090 --> 54:58.040
- Trust me on this one okay?
- You're out of control gorgeous

54:58.040 --> 55:01.150
- It's time to go to bed.
- Give me a little smooch.

55:01.170 --> 55:03.130
Come on you know you want to.

55:03.130 --> 55:04.190
You just peed the suit.

55:04.190 --> 55:06.520
- I know, has a filtration system.
- It's not sexy.

55:06.520 --> 55:09.050
- You can drink that water.
- Just send everybody home, okay.

55:09.050 --> 55:11.130
- It's time to...
- If you say so.

55:11.130 --> 55:13.130
Okay, I'll take this.

55:13.130 --> 55:16.100
You take that.

55:16.100 --> 55:19.100
Pepper Potts.

55:19.100 --> 55:21.100
She's right.
The party is over.

55:21.100 --> 55:24.140
Then again the party was over for me
like an hour and a half ago.

55:24.150 --> 55:27.310
The after party
starts in 15 minutes!

55:30.150 --> 55:33.330
And if anybody, Pepper, doesn't like it,

55:33.630 --> 55:36.230
there's the door.

55:46.070 --> 55:49.240
Shoot!

55:55.120 --> 55:58.280
Shoot!

56:06.130 --> 56:09.340
Shoot!

56:12.170 --> 56:15.250
Me!

56:16.130 --> 56:19.250
I think she wants the Gallanger!

56:21.090 --> 56:24.260
There you go!

56:27.100 --> 56:30.260
I'm only gonna say this once.

56:33.010 --> 56:36.130
Get out!

56:40.970 --> 56:44.140
You don't deserve to wear one of these.
Shut it down!

56:44.980 --> 56:47.980
Goldstein.

56:47.980 --> 56:48.980
Yes, Mr. Stark?

56:48.980 --> 56:52.140
Give me a fat beat to beat
my buddy's ass to...

56:56.130 --> 56:59.100
I told you to shut it down.

57:08.950 --> 57:12.110
Now, put that thing back where you found it
before someone gets hurt.

57:18.910 --> 57:22.160
Really?

57:28.210 --> 57:31.690
Sorry pal, but
Iron Man doesn't have a sidekick.

57:32.380 --> 57:36.130
Suck at this!

57:42.970 --> 57:44.920
Had enough?

57:44.920 --> 57:46.970
- Natalie!
- Ms. Potts ...

57:46.970 --> 57:50.860
Don't you Ms. Potts me. I'm on to you.
You know what, ever since you came here...

57:54.930 --> 57:57.930
Pepper!

57:57.930 --> 58:01.100
Let's get out of here!

58:04.980 --> 58:08.190
You want it?
Take it!

58:30.950 --> 58:34.160
Out!

58:49.010 --> 58:51.010
Put your hand down.

58:51.010 --> 58:53.010
You think you got what it takes
to wear that suit?

58:53.010 --> 58:55.040
- We don't have to do this, Tony.
- You wanna be a war machine?

58:55.050 --> 58:57.480
- Take your shot.
- Put it down!

58:57.480 --> 59:00.050
- You're gonna take your shot?
- Put it down, now!

59:00.060 --> 59:03.180
- Drop it Tony
- Take it!

01:00:12.490 --> 01:00:16.830
<i>Tower this is Lt. Col. James Rhodes
eastbound for 3 miles,...</i>

01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:03.680
Colonel.

01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:06.250
Major.

01:01:08.910 --> 01:01:10.030
Yeah.

01:01:12.130 --> 01:01:14.220
Let's take it inside.

01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:15.520
<i>Clear the area.</i>

01:01:38.230 --> 01:01:42.310
Sir! I'm gonna have to ask you
to exit the donut.

01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:48.580
I told you I don't wanna
join your super secret boyband.

01:01:49.150 --> 01:01:52.320
No, see, I remember, you do
everything myself.

01:01:52.390 --> 01:01:54.400
How's it workin out for you?

01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:00.710
I'm sorry, I don't wanna get off on the wrong
foot, do I look in the patch or the eye?

01:02:02.070 --> 01:02:05.280
Honestly I'm a bit hungover
I'm not sure if you're real or if...

01:02:05.550 --> 01:02:09.890
I am very real. I'm the realest
person you're ever gonna meet.

01:02:10.210 --> 01:02:13.680
- Just my luck. Where is the staff here?
- Oh, that's not lookin too good.

01:02:14.690 --> 01:02:16.980
It's getting worse.

01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:21.420
We've secured the perimeter, but I don't think
we should hold it for too much longer.

01:02:25.690 --> 01:02:28.810
- You're fired.
- That's not up to you.

01:02:29.090 --> 01:02:32.000
- Tony... I want you to meet agent Romanoff
- Hi

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:36.040
I'm a Shield shadow
and I was tasked to you by Dr. Fury.

01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:37.600
I suggest you apologize.

01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:39.730
You've been very busy.

01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:43.260
Made your girl your CEO,
you've given away all your stuff.

01:02:43.350 --> 01:02:45.510
You let your friend
fly away with your suit.

01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:47.980
- If I didn't know better...
- You don't know better.

01:02:48.670 --> 01:02:50.590
I didn't give it to him.
He took it.

01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:55.830
He took it? You're Iron Man
and he just took it?

01:02:56.010 --> 01:02:58.350
Little brother walked in there kicked your ass
and took your suit?

01:02:58.410 --> 01:03:00.000
Is that possible?

01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:02.580
According to Mr. Stark's database
security guidelines

01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:05.660
There are redundancies to prevent
unauthorized usage.

01:03:08.270 --> 01:03:10.660
- What do you want from me?
- What do we want from you? No, no, no!

01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:12.790
What do you want from me.

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:16.810
You have become a problem, a problem
I have to deal with.

01:03:16.810 --> 01:03:20.150
- Contrary to your belief, you are not
the center of my universe. - Yeah I get it.

01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:24.540
I have bigger problems than you in the Southwest
region to deal with. Hit him.

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:29.110
Are you gonna steal my kidney and sell it?

01:03:29.590 --> 01:03:32.800
Could you please not do anything
awful for 5 seconds?

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.160
What did you just do to me?

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:36.630
What did we just do for you.

01:03:36.770 --> 01:03:40.630
That's lithium dioxide. It's gonna take the edge off.
We're trying to get you back to work.

01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:45.160
- Give me a couple of boxes and I'll be right as rain.
- It's not a cure, it's just to break the symptoms.

01:03:45.210 --> 01:03:49.940
- Then the lag is gonna be an easy fix.
- Trust me I know I'm good at this stuff.

01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:52.690
I've been looking for a suitable replacement
for palladium.

01:03:52.690 --> 01:03:56.600
I've tried every combination, every permutation of
every known element.

01:03:56.680 --> 01:04:00.170
Well, I'm here to tell you
you haven't tried them all.

01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:04.520
Hey, hey, hey.
Special delivery.

01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:06.170
Candygram!

01:04:10.010 --> 01:04:12.260
I brought you something.

01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:19.960
- We got you the bird, pal.
- This is not my bird.

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:23.700
What do you mean?
That's the bird.

01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:25.400
I pulled a lot of strings
to get this bird.

01:04:25.450 --> 01:04:27.800
- It's a great bird.
- It's a beautiful bird.

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:32.230
- We got this all the way from Russia.
- Hey man, it's not my bird.

01:04:34.190 --> 01:04:38.530
Well listen, even if it's not the bird,
I mean this is a gorgeous bird.

01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:42.490
I mean, look, don't get so attached to
things, learn to let go.

01:04:45.590 --> 01:04:48.360
Wait a minute.
Jack, what is that?

01:04:48.590 --> 01:04:51.800
Is that...
That's not a helmet. What is that?

01:05:00.210 --> 01:05:03.940
Ivan... What's this?
Jack?

01:05:04.730 --> 01:05:09.420
Is that a helmet? It doesn't look like a helmet
to me. How are you supposed to get a head in there?

01:05:09.510 --> 01:05:12.680
- Jack, could you put your head in there? - No.
- Try to put your head in there.

01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:14.550
Go ahead, try to put your head in there.

01:05:14.650 --> 01:05:17.210
See Ivan, he can't put his head in
there. That's...

01:05:17.610 --> 01:05:19.890
That's not a helmet, it's a head.

01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:21.340
I need to put a guy in there.

01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:25.340
I need to fit a person
in that suit, you understand?

01:05:25.610 --> 01:05:26.730
Drone better.

01:05:26.790 --> 01:05:28.560
What? Drone better?
Why is drone better?

01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:30.480
Why drone better?

01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:32.410
People make problem.

01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:34.390
Trust me,
drone better.

01:05:34.790 --> 01:05:39.170
Ivan, you know I like you.
I got you the bird.

01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:44.520
You said no problem.
That's what you said to me, you said no problem.

01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:47.530
Now I need suits.
The government wants suits.

01:05:47.540 --> 01:05:49.580
Like Iron Man, you understand?

01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:53.010
That's what the people want.
That's what's gonna make them happy.

01:05:53.540 --> 01:05:55.090
Hey, man...

01:05:56.410 --> 01:05:59.520
Don't get to attached to things.

01:05:59.540 --> 01:06:01.360
Learn to let go.

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:08.070
These drones better steal the show, Ivan.

01:06:08.070 --> 01:06:11.840
You understand? They better
rock my world, Ivan.

01:06:21.330 --> 01:06:23.200
Unbelievable.

01:06:23.420 --> 01:06:26.150
This ought to get the Senate off my ass.

01:06:26.250 --> 01:06:29.720
- It's functional?
- Fully mission-capable.

01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:32.980
Good. Get Hammer down here
to weaponize it.

01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:35.120
Sir?

01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:38.120
Justin Hammer's making a weapons presentation
at the expo.

01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:39.780
We'd like this to introduce it.

01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:41.340
Sir, I don't believe that the expo is...

01:06:41.350 --> 01:06:44.380
Colonel, the world needs
to see this fast.

01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:46.170
We've got to make this happen.

01:06:46.170 --> 01:06:49.380
- Yes general, but the...
- It's also an order.

01:06:49.830 --> 01:06:51.300
Yes, sir.

01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:54.470
Good work, Colonel.
You've made your country proud.

01:06:55.180 --> 01:06:56.860
Thank you, sir.

01:07:03.010 --> 01:07:06.700
That thing in your chest is
based on unfinished technology.

01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:09.650
No it was finished,
it's never been particularly effective until

01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:12.700
I've miniaturized it
and put it in my...

01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:16.120
No, Howard said that the arc reactor was
a stepping stone to something greater.

01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:17.750
He was about to kick off an energy race

01:07:17.790 --> 01:07:20.880
That was gonna dwarf
the arms race.

01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:24.280
He was on to something big,
something so big

01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:27.970
that it was gonna make the nuclear reactor
look like a AAA battery.

01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:30.410
Just him? Or was Anton Vanko in on this too?

01:07:30.410 --> 01:07:33.710
Anton Vanko is the other
side of that coin.

01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:36.000
Anton saw it as a
way to get rich.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.420
When your father found
out he had him deported.

01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:42.070
When the Russians found out he couldn't
deliver they shipped his ass off to Siberia

01:07:42.070 --> 01:07:44.850
and he spent the next 20 years on a vodka
fuel rage.

01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:47.410
Not quite the environment you wanna raise
a kid in.

01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:51.590
His son you had the misfortune of
crossing paths with in Monaco.

01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:54.260
You told me I hadn't tried everything.
What do you mean I haven't tried everything?

01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:55.850
What haven't I tried?

01:07:55.850 --> 01:07:59.680
He said that you were the only person with the
means and knowledge

01:07:59.910 --> 01:08:02.030
to finish what he started.

01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:03.420
He said that?

01:08:03.650 --> 01:08:06.030
Are you that guy?
Huh? Are you?

01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:12.210
Because if you are then
you can solve the riddle of your heart.

01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:19.740
I don't know where you get your information, but
he wasn't my biggest fan.

01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:22.779
- What do your remember about your dad huh?
- He was cold, he was calculating...

01:08:22.779 --> 01:08:25.830
He never told me he loved me
he never even told me he liked me.

01:08:25.830 --> 01:08:30.439
So it's a little tough for me to digest what're you telling
me he said the whole future is riding on me

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:32.870
and he's passing it down...
I don't get that.

01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:34.609
We're talking about a guy
whose happiest day

01:08:34.609 --> 01:08:36.180
was when he shipped me off to boarding school.

01:08:36.210 --> 01:08:37.319
That's not true.

01:08:37.319 --> 01:08:39.830
Well, then clearly you know my dad better
than I did.

01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:42.170
As a matter of fact I did.

01:08:42.290 --> 01:08:44.050
He was one of the founding members
of The Shield.

01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:46.970
- What?
- I got a two o'clock.

01:08:46.970 --> 01:08:48.800
Wait, wait, what's this?

01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:50.670
- Okay, you're good, right?
- No I'm not good.

01:08:50.670 --> 01:08:53.660
- You got this, right? - Got what? I don't
even know what I'm supposed to get.

01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:56.890
Natasha will remain
a floater at Stark with her cover intact

01:08:56.890 --> 01:08:58.920
and you remember
Agent Colson right?

01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:00.399
Yeah.

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:01.750
Oh, and Tony...

01:09:02.810 --> 01:09:05.970
Remember, I got my eye on you.

01:09:11.990 --> 01:09:14.569
We've disabled all communications,
no contact with the outside world.

01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:16.399
Good luck.

01:09:20.819 --> 01:09:22.640
Please...

01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:25.990
First thing I need a little body work.
I'll put in a little time at the lab.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:30.689
If you could send of your goon squad down to the Coffee Bean
across the street or Starbucks, that'll be nice.

01:09:30.689 --> 01:09:33.340
I'm not here for that.
I've been authorized by

01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:36.130
Director Fury to use any means necessary
to keep you on premises.

01:09:36.130 --> 01:09:38.870
- If you attempt to leave - Right
- or play any games

01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:40.260
I will taze you and watch

01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:42.080
Supernanny while you
drool into the carpet. Okay?

01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:45.990
- I think I got it, yeah.
- Enjoy your evening's entertainment.

01:10:12.630 --> 01:10:14.450
Think this
is the power source?

01:10:14.450 --> 01:10:17.360
Major, this is not a scientific exercise.

01:10:17.370 --> 01:10:19.530
Let's just focus
on arming it, alright?

01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:22.150
Yes, sir.

01:10:22.150 --> 01:10:23.580
<i> Oh, yes!</i>

01:10:23.890 --> 01:10:25.840
Oh, yes, yes, yes!

01:10:25.890 --> 01:10:27.890
Is it my birthday?

01:10:27.940 --> 01:10:31.450
You gotta.. what did you do?
What did you do?

01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:37.110
- Is this what I think it is?
- Yes it is.

01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:40.730
Hammer, I want to know
what you're gonna do for us.

01:10:40.910 --> 01:10:42.960
What am I gonna do for you?

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.770
First thing I'm gonna do for you is
I'm gonna upgrade your software,

01:10:48.420 --> 01:10:51.610
I'm talking about firepower.

01:10:53.020 --> 01:10:55.140
Well you're talking to the right guy.

01:10:56.010 --> 01:10:59.390
Claridge Hi-Tec semi-automatic 9 mm pistol.

01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:03.000
Too downtown?
I agree.

01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:05.910
M-24 shotgun pump action.

01:11:06.310 --> 01:11:08.960
5-round magazine, but
you know what, you're not a hunter.

01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:11.030
What am I talking about?
I'm getting rid of it.

01:11:11.050 --> 01:11:13.850
This is the FN-2000 from Belgium.

01:11:13.850 --> 01:11:15.610
They do make something better than waffles.

01:11:16.710 --> 01:11:19.110
It's beautiful, but I can tell this isn't
disco enough for you

01:11:19.110 --> 01:11:20.630
so I'm gonna put it right here.

01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:25.230
You're looking at a Milkor 40 mm grenade launcher.
Tear gas, smoke.

01:11:25.230 --> 01:11:27.610
Hippie control.
You're tough.

01:11:27.610 --> 01:11:30.540
Let me tell you something,
Size does matter.

01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:32.370
Don't let anyone tell you different.

01:11:32.530 --> 01:11:37.370
This is an M134 7.62 minigun.
Six individual barrels.

01:11:37.370 --> 01:11:39.800
The torso taker, powder maker.

01:11:39.830 --> 01:11:43.630
Our boys in uniform call it Uncle Gazpacho
or Puff the Magic Dragon.

01:11:46.930 --> 01:11:48.140
Okay.

01:11:49.930 --> 01:11:53.820
These are the Cubans baby.
These are the Cohibas, the Montecristos...

01:11:55.190 --> 01:11:57.440
That's a kinetic-kill sidewinder vehicle

01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:01.660
with a secondary cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine
RDX burst.

01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:05.870
It's capable of busting a bunker under
the bunker you just busted.

01:12:05.870 --> 01:12:07.870
If it were any smarter it would write a book.

01:12:07.870 --> 01:12:11.220
A book that would make Ulysses look like
it was written in crayon.

01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:13.430
And would read it to you.

01:12:14.170 --> 01:12:17.760
This is my Eiffel Tower,
This is my Rachmaninoff's Third.

01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:21.770
My Pieta. It's completely
elegant, it's bafflingly beautiful.

01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:26.400
And it's capable of reducing the population
of any standing structure to zero.

01:12:27.730 --> 01:12:30.240
I call it the Ex-Wife.

01:12:34.820 --> 01:12:36.660
That's the best I got.

01:12:41.670 --> 01:12:44.540
How are you gonna do this? Give me something.
You're like a sphinx.

01:12:44.590 --> 01:12:46.090
I can't read you.

01:12:46.590 --> 01:12:47.840
I think I'll take it.

01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:50.470
- Which one?
- All of it.

01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:53.770
All of it?

01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:27.860
<i>Action.</i>

01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:34.880
<i>Everything is achievable through technology.</i>

01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:37.200
<i>Better living,
robust health.</i>

01:13:37.410 --> 01:13:40.830
<i>And for the first time
in human history...</i>

01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:43.590
<i>the possibility of world peace.</i>

01:13:43.790 --> 01:13:47.230
<i>I'm Howard Stark. And everything
you'll need for the future,</i>

01:13:47.230 --> 01:13:48.760
<i>can be found right here.</i>

01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:52.970
<i> City of Future, City of
of Tomorrow? Hang on.</i>

01:13:57.890 --> 01:13:59.270
<i>I'm Howard Stark.</i>

01:13:59.270 --> 01:14:02.280
<i> And everything you'll need in
the future can be found right here.</i>

01:14:03.070 --> 01:14:07.790
<i> So, from all of us in
Stark Industries I would like to personally...</i>

01:14:08.950 --> 01:14:11.120
<i> Tony? What are you doing back there?
What is that?</i>

01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:14.090
<i>Put it back.
Put it back where you got it from.</i>

01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:17.050
<i>Where is your mother?
Maria...</i>

01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:19.890
<i>Go on, go, go, go...</i>

01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:23.680
<i>Sorry I think we got the...</i>

01:14:24.430 --> 01:14:26.770
<i>I'll come in in there...</i>

01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:32.260
<i>Are you waiting on me?</i>

01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:38.080
<i>So from all of us in
Stark Industries I'd like to personally show you...</i>

01:14:39.370 --> 01:14:40.490
<i> my ass.</i>

01:14:40.490 --> 01:14:45.080
<i>I'd like to... This...
I can't... We have this don't we?</i>

01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:47.630
<i>That looks ridiculous.</i>

01:14:48.590 --> 01:14:49.920
<i>Everything...</i>

01:14:51.090 --> 01:14:52.850
<i>is achievable...</i>

01:14:53.510 --> 01:14:54.770
<i>through technology.</i>

01:15:07.610 --> 01:15:09.110
<i>Tony...</i>

01:15:09.110 --> 01:15:13.370
<i>You're too young to understand this right now
so I thought I would put it on film for you.</i>

01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:17.750
<i> I built this for you.</i>

01:15:18.630 --> 01:15:23.220
<i> And someday you'll realize that it represents
a whole lot more than just people's inventions.</i>

01:15:23.670 --> 01:15:25.720
<i>It represents my life's work.</i>

01:15:26.430 --> 01:15:28.690
<i>This is key to the future.</i>

01:15:31.810 --> 01:15:34.400
<i>I'm limited by the technology
of my time.</i>

01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:36.900
<i> But one day you'll figure this out.</i>

01:15:37.230 --> 01:15:41.740
<i>And when you do...
you will change the world.</i>

01:15:43.490 --> 01:15:47.790
<i> What is and always will be
my greatest creation...</i>

01:15:49.790 --> 01:15:51.470
<i>is you.</i>

01:16:11.110 --> 01:16:12.530
Hi, sir.

01:16:12.530 --> 01:16:15.350
- $6.
- I don't have any...

01:16:15.350 --> 01:16:18.170
- No sir, that's too much.
- No it's fine, take that.

01:16:20.830 --> 01:16:22.360
Take it, take it.

01:16:22.610 --> 01:16:25.490
I don't like people hand me things so if you
could just drop that there that would be great.

01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:28.140
- Are you Iron Man?
- Sometimes.

01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:30.020
We believe in you!

01:16:30.510 --> 01:16:33.310
It was an illegal seizure
of trademarked property.

01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:35.940
- Ms. Potts, Mr Stark is...
- Here.

01:16:35.940 --> 01:16:39.200
- He refuses to...
- I don't. It's fine. I'll just be a second.

01:16:39.570 --> 01:16:45.370
It's our position that Stark has the means to maintain
proprietary ownership of the Mark II platform.

01:16:45.780 --> 01:16:48.660
<i>When Mr. Stark announced he was the Iron Man</i>

01:16:48.660 --> 01:16:52.880
<i>he was making a promise to America.</i>

01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:54.880
<i>Obviously he did not.</i>

01:16:55.130 --> 01:16:57.160
<i>Now we learn that his secretary,</i>

01:16:57.220 --> 01:16:59.760
<i>a woman named
Virginia "Pepper" Potts,</i>

01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:02.180
<i>has been appointed CEO
of Stark Industries executive.</i>

01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:04.470
<i>What are her qualifications?</i>

01:17:04.470 --> 01:17:05.100
No.

01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:07.570
- Ms. Potts is doing nothing to manage the terrible
situation... - Mute.

01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:13.780
Bert, don't tell me that we have the
best patent lawyers in the country

01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:15.580
and then not let me pursue this.

01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:17.280
I'll get this stuff out of here.

01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:19.420
Well then, tell the President
to sign an order.

01:17:20.750 --> 01:17:23.040
We'll talk about it at the expo.

01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:25.260
Hammer's giving some presentation
tomorrow evening.

01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:29.050
- Will Tony Stark be there?
- Will I?

01:17:29.050 --> 01:17:31.060
- No, he will not.
- I'd like to be.

01:17:32.550 --> 01:17:33.850
- Got a minute?
- No.

01:17:33.850 --> 01:17:35.980
Come on, you just got off the phone.
30 seconds.

01:17:38.770 --> 01:17:41.070
29 ... 28 ...

01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:45.660
I was driving over here, and I thought
I was coming basically to apologize, but I'm not.

01:17:45.740 --> 01:17:49.710
- You didn't come here to apologize?
- That goes without saying, and I'm working on that.

01:17:49.950 --> 01:17:53.710
But I haven't been entirely up front
with you

01:17:53.710 --> 01:17:55.380
and I just wanna try to make good,

01:17:55.380 --> 01:17:58.840
Can I move this?
This is crazy I got ferris wheel...

01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:00.050
No.

01:18:02.970 --> 01:18:04.810
Do you know how short life is?

01:18:05.390 --> 01:18:08.390
And if I never got to express...

01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:11.270
and by the way somewhat revelatory to me,

01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:14.090
I don't care... I mean, I care, it would be nice,

01:18:14.090 --> 01:18:16.950
I'm not expecting you to...
Look, here's what I'm trying to say.

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:20.280
Let me just stop you right here, okay,
because if you say "I"

01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:23.670
one more time, I'm gonna actually hurl
something at your head, I think.

01:18:24.710 --> 01:18:28.460
I am trying to run a company.
Do you know have any idea what that entails?

01:18:28.460 --> 01:18:29.340
Yes.

01:18:29.420 --> 01:18:32.380
People are relying on you to be
Iron Man, and you've disappeared.

01:18:32.380 --> 01:18:35.770
All I'm doing is putting out your fire
and taking the heat for it.

01:18:38.350 --> 01:18:42.070
I am trying to do the job that you
were meant to do.

01:18:45.570 --> 01:18:47.490
Did you bring me strawberries?

01:18:48.820 --> 01:18:53.070
Did you know that there is only one thing
on earth that I am allergic to?

01:18:53.070 --> 01:18:54.250
You're allergic to strawberries, uh-uh.

01:18:57.170 --> 01:19:00.880
This is progress, Pepper. I knew there
was correlation between you and this...

01:19:02.010 --> 01:19:04.180
- I need you...
- And I need you too, that's what I'm trying to say.

01:19:04.260 --> 01:19:06.770
to leave now.

01:19:11.350 --> 01:19:12.520
Ms Potts.

01:19:13.270 --> 01:19:16.740
- Hi, come on in.
- Wheel's up in 25 minutes.

01:19:17.110 --> 01:19:18.680
Thank you.

01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:21.450
Anything else, boss?

01:19:21.450 --> 01:19:25.080
- I'm good Hap.
- I'll be just... another minute.

01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:28.000
I lost both the kids in the divorce.

01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:33.110
No.

01:19:35.260 --> 01:19:38.060
Are you blending in well here, Natalie?

01:19:38.300 --> 01:19:40.770
Here at Stark... Enterprises.

01:19:41.390 --> 01:19:43.070
Your name is Natalie, isn't it?

01:19:43.770 --> 01:19:47.110
I thought you two
didn't get along.

01:19:47.110 --> 01:19:49.530
- No, that's not so.
- It's just me you don't care for.

01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:51.400
No? Nothing?

01:19:51.410 --> 01:19:55.700
Actually while you're here maybe you and Natalie
could discuss the matter of personal belonging.

01:19:55.700 --> 01:19:56.880
Absolutely.

01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:08.090
- I'm surprised you could keep your mouth shut.
- You're good. You are mind-blowingly duplicitous.

01:20:08.090 --> 01:20:08.940
How do you do it?

01:20:08.940 --> 01:20:11.710
You're a triple impostor.
I've never seen anything like it.

01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:13.790
Is there anything real about you?
Do you even speak Latin?

01:20:13.790 --> 01:20:15.980
Fallaces sunt rerum species.

01:20:15.990 --> 01:20:18.930
Which means?
What did you just say?

01:20:18.930 --> 01:20:21.730
It means you can either drive yourself home
or I can have you collected.

01:20:23.860 --> 01:20:25.320
You're good!

01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:27.940
Jarvis, could you kindly
backform a digital wireframe?

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:29.610
I need a manipulable projection.

01:21:37.870 --> 01:21:41.170
1974 Stark Expo model scanning
complete, sir.

01:21:43.210 --> 01:21:47.760
- How many buildings are there?
- Am I to include the Belgian waffles stand?

01:21:47.970 --> 01:21:49.970
It was rhetorical, just show me.

01:22:02.820 --> 01:22:04.870
What does that look like to you, Jarvis?

01:22:05.660 --> 01:22:07.500
Not unlike an atom.

01:22:07.740 --> 01:22:11.670
In which case, the nucleus... would be here.

01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:14.050
Highlight the Unisphere.

01:22:22.950 --> 01:22:28.230
- Notice the footpaths. Get rid of them.
- What is it you're trying to achieve, sir?

01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:31.860
I'm discovering,... correction, rediscovering...

01:22:32.900 --> 01:22:34.200
... a new element.

01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:38.660
Lose the landscape and the shrubbery there,
trees,

01:22:38.660 --> 01:22:40.620
parking lots, exits, entrances.

01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:47.630
Structre protons and neutrons

01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:51.470
using flags the pavillions as the framework.

01:23:16.420 --> 01:23:18.760
Dead for almost 20 years...

01:23:20.210 --> 01:23:22.260
...still taking me to school.

01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:32.320
The proposed element should serve
as a viable replacement for palladium.

01:23:32.810 --> 01:23:33.980
Thanks, Dad.

01:23:33.980 --> 01:23:36.950
Unfortunately,
it is impossible to synthesize.

01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:45.040
Get ready for major remodel, fellas!
We're back in hardware mode.

01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:35.080
How did you break the perimeter?

01:24:35.150 --> 01:24:37.270
That was like three years ago.
Where have you been?

01:24:37.270 --> 01:24:40.490
- I was doing some stuff.
- Yeah, well, me too and it worked.

01:24:41.990 --> 01:24:46.200
Hey, I'm playing for the home team, Colson
You and all your Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers.

01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:48.130
Let me work, or break my balls?

01:24:49.710 --> 01:24:51.050
What's this doing here?

01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:55.140
That's it.

01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:57.180
Bring it to me.

01:24:57.510 --> 01:24:59.930
- You know what this is?
- It's exactly what I need to make this work.

01:25:01.700 --> 01:25:02.980
Lift the coil.

01:25:02.980 --> 01:25:03.060
Go, go! Put your knees under it.
There you go.
Lift the coil.

01:25:03.060 --> 01:25:06.030
Go, go! Put your knees under it.
There you go.

01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:07.490
And...

01:25:08.230 --> 01:25:10.160
- Drop it. - Okay.

01:25:13.490 --> 01:25:14.580
Perfectly level.

01:25:15.450 --> 01:25:17.500
- I'm busy. What do you want?
- Nothing.

01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:20.210
Good bye. I've been reassigned.

01:25:20.330 --> 01:25:21.920
Director Fury wants me in New Mexico.

01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:24.720
- Fantastic, the land of enchantment.
- So I'm told.

01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:26.510
- Secret stuff.
- Something like that.

01:25:27.970 --> 01:25:29.100
- Good luck.
- Bye.

01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:31.260
- Thanks.
- We need you.

01:25:31.260 --> 01:25:33.980
- Yeah, more than you know.
- Not that much.

01:25:52.380 --> 01:25:54.720
<i>Initializing
prismatic accelerator.</i>

01:26:01.180 --> 01:26:03.730
<i>Approaching maximum power.</i>

01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:52.460
That was easy.

01:27:08.830 --> 01:27:10.730
<i>Congratulations, sir.</i>

01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:14.780
<i>You have created a new element.</i>

01:27:22.850 --> 01:27:26.380
<i>Sir, the reactor has accepted the
modified core.</i>

01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:29.170
<i>I will begin running diagnostics.</i>

01:27:35.180 --> 01:27:36.940
Hey, Ivan.

01:27:37.390 --> 01:27:41.250
<i>I got Senator Stern here. Thought we'd swing over
and look at some of the drone designs.</i>

01:27:41.250 --> 01:27:41.560
- The drone is not going to be ready.
- Not ready... What do you mean?
<i>I got Senator Stern here. Thought we'd swing over
and look at some of the drone designs.</i>

01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:45.110
- The drone is not going to be ready.
- Not ready... What do you mean?

01:27:45.650 --> 01:27:48.700
It can make presentation
not demonstration.

01:27:48.780 --> 01:27:53.750
- What the hell is the difference?
- Presentation, no fly, no shoot.

01:27:53.830 --> 01:27:57.000
Wait. What can we make 'em do, I mean,

01:27:57.060 --> 01:27:58.880
This is a weapons demonstration.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:00.630
I can make salute.

01:28:01.130 --> 01:28:03.720
You can make salute, what do you mean
make salute?

01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:05.810
What the hell does that mean, Ivan?

01:28:06.100 --> 01:28:08.480
<i>It's not what we agreed to, okay.</i>

01:28:08.490 --> 01:28:11.140
<i>You promised me suits, and then you promised
me drones.</i>

01:28:11.140 --> 01:28:15.030
- Hey man, everything will be okay.
- This is not what I wanted.

01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:29.840
Hey, there he is, the bird man.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.930
Oh, now you like the bird, is that right?

01:28:34.090 --> 01:28:37.270
Is that your bird?
I'm confused.

01:28:37.890 --> 01:28:41.270
You said it wasn't, but now
it's like you're best of pals.

01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:42.940
You love that bird, don't you?

01:28:43.690 --> 01:28:45.360
You know what? Take the bird.

01:28:50.530 --> 01:28:53.040
Take his pillows too. Both of them.

01:28:53.950 --> 01:28:55.790
And shoes, take his shoes.

01:29:00.170 --> 01:29:01.720
I took your stuff.

01:29:02.170 --> 01:29:05.300
How does that make you feel?
You feel bad?

01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:08.810
Good. Cause that's how I feel!

01:29:10.510 --> 01:29:12.520
We had a contract!

01:29:12.730 --> 01:29:17.780
I saved your life
and you give me suits.

01:29:18.070 --> 01:29:21.740
That was our deal.
And you did not deliver.

01:29:22.740 --> 01:29:25.660
I don't know if you're a genius
or a fraud.

01:29:25.670 --> 01:29:27.580
I don't know what you are!

01:29:29.580 --> 01:29:32.800
Something really, really great fell into my lap.

01:29:33.670 --> 01:29:36.800
If it hadn't, I'd be at your mercy tonight.

01:29:37.010 --> 01:29:41.050
Now I have a piece of Stark tech, and I pimped
out myself.

01:29:41.050 --> 01:29:45.480
Now your overpriced paperweights are gonna
look like a backdrop to my demonstration.

01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:47.860
You dig what I'm gettin' at here?

01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:54.660
I don't know if you noticed,
but I don't speak Russian!

01:29:58.120 --> 01:30:03.300
I'm gonna leave now. I'm gonna go to the expo.
Maybe I'll even get laid.

01:30:04.090 --> 01:30:08.050
See these guys? They're your babysitters.
They are not to be trifled with.

01:30:09.050 --> 01:30:12.520
When I get back, we're gonna renegotiate the
terms of our agreement.

01:30:13.720 --> 01:30:16.180
And you're gonna make good on our arrangements.

01:30:16.180 --> 01:30:18.860
Because if you don't, you're gonna be exactly what you were
when I found you,

01:30:18.900 --> 01:30:21.320
a dead man.

01:30:21.690 --> 01:30:23.110
You got that?

01:30:24.070 --> 01:30:26.370
Maybe you can watch me on TV.

01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:38.010
Dummy. You.
Can we clean up this mess?

01:30:38.670 --> 01:30:42.850
- Incoming call with a blocked number, sir.
- Phone privileges reinstated.

01:30:42.860 --> 01:30:44.520
Lovely.

01:30:44.760 --> 01:30:49.440
- Colson, how's land of enchantment?
- Hey, Tony, how you doin'?

01:30:50.650 --> 01:30:52.280
- I doubled cycle. - You what?

01:30:53.400 --> 01:30:57.820
You told me double cycle's
more power. Good advice.

01:30:57.820 --> 01:31:01.460
- You sound pretty spitely for a dead guy.
- You too.

01:31:03.710 --> 01:31:04.750
- Trace it. - Sir.

01:31:04.750 --> 01:31:09.260
Now the true history of
Stark name will be written.

01:31:09.300 --> 01:31:12.310
- Jarvis, where he is?
- Accessing the Oracle grid.

01:31:12.930 --> 01:31:14.390
Eastern seaboard.

01:31:14.510 --> 01:31:18.560
What your father did to my family
over 40 years

01:31:19.310 --> 01:31:21.770
I will do to you in 40 minutes.

01:31:21.770 --> 01:31:24.230
Sounds good, let's get together
and hash it out.

01:31:24.230 --> 01:31:27.950
Tri-state area.
Manhattan and outlying boroughs.

01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:29.950
I hope you're ready.

01:31:32.830 --> 01:31:34.670
<i>Call trace incomplete.</i>

01:31:45.390 --> 01:31:48.020
- Sir.
- You wanna run some tests, run 'em.

01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:51.270
And assemble the suit while you're at it
put it together now.

01:31:51.270 --> 01:31:53.740
- We are unclear as to the effects...
- I don't wanna hear it, Jarvis!

01:31:57.900 --> 01:32:01.250
It tastes like coconut...
and metal.

01:32:15.860 --> 01:32:19.440
I'll keep the car down here, alright.
- Thank you Happy.

01:32:19.450 --> 01:32:25.030
<i>Justin Hammer, his presentation will begin shortly
in the main pavilion.</i>

01:32:45.050 --> 01:32:48.100
That's what I'm talking about!
Thanks for coming.

01:32:49.260 --> 01:32:52.310
Ladies and gentlemen,
for far too long

01:32:52.810 --> 01:32:55.940
this country has had to place its brave men
and women in harm's way.

01:32:56.230 --> 01:32:58.470
But then the Iron Man arrived
and we thought that

01:32:58.530 --> 01:33:01.080
the days of losing lives were behind us.

01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:04.700
Sadly that technology was kept out of reach.

01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:07.210
That's not fair. That's not right.

01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:09.870
- And it's just too bad.
- Oh, lord...

01:33:09.870 --> 01:33:14.840
Regardless it was an impressive innovation
one that grabbed headlines the world over.

01:33:15.300 --> 01:33:20.480
Today, my friends, the press
is faced with quite a different problem.

01:33:21.100 --> 01:33:24.400
They are about to run out of ink.

01:33:29.230 --> 01:33:30.570
Get that out of here.

01:33:32.070 --> 01:33:33.870
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:33:34.870 --> 01:33:36.960
...today I present to you

01:33:37.450 --> 01:33:40.920
...the new face of the United States military!

01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:43.670
The Hammer drone!

01:33:45.940 --> 01:33:48.050
Army!

01:34:00.170 --> 01:34:05.080
Navy!

01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:14.380
Air Force!

01:34:20.740 --> 01:34:23.600
Marines!

01:34:40.140 --> 01:34:43.520
That's a hell of a lot better than some
cheerleaders, let me tell you.

01:34:44.790 --> 01:34:47.510
But as revolutionary
as this technology is,

01:34:47.550 --> 01:34:51.390
there will always be a need for a man
to be present at the theater of war.

01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:56.930
Ladies and gentlemen, today I am proud
to present to you the very first prototype

01:34:56.930 --> 01:35:00.790
the variable threat response battle suit

01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:04.070
and its pilot Air Force Lt. Col. James Rhodes.

01:35:05.020 --> 01:35:06.630
What?

01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:30.620
For America and its allies,
Hammer Industries, is reporting...

01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:50.200
We got trouble.

01:35:50.200 --> 01:35:52.200
Tony, there are civilians present.

01:35:52.200 --> 01:35:54.740
I'm here on orders.
Let's not do this right now.

01:35:54.750 --> 01:35:57.350
Give them a wave.

01:35:57.860 --> 01:36:00.150
All these people are in danger.
We gotta get them out of here.

01:36:00.150 --> 01:36:02.400
You gotta trust
me for the next five minutes.

01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:04.400
I tried that and
I got tossed around your house, remember?

01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:06.870
I think he's working with Vanko.

01:36:06.870 --> 01:36:10.050
Vanko is alive?

01:36:10.630 --> 01:36:13.160
- Where is he?
- What?

01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:14.880
Where is Vanko?

01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:17.170
- Who?
- Tell me.

01:36:17.170 --> 01:36:20.060
What are you doing here, man?

01:36:24.580 --> 01:36:27.900
- Is that you?
- No, I'm not doing that, it's not me.

01:36:27.900 --> 01:36:31.080
I can't move.
I'm locked up, I'm locked up.

01:36:31.490 --> 01:36:34.910
Get out of here! Go!
The whole system's been compromised!

01:36:34.910 --> 01:36:38.050
Let's take it outside.

01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:52.060
No!

01:37:00.110 --> 01:37:03.080
- Jarvis, break in, I need to own him.
- Yes, sir.

01:37:05.910 --> 01:37:08.600
Tony, I'm locked on I have target locked.

01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:12.090
- On what?
- On you.

01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:17.860
Tony on your six.

01:37:33.900 --> 01:37:36.910
- What's going on, what's happening?
- The software's been overwritten.

01:37:36.910 --> 01:37:38.910
What?
What do you mean it's been overwritten?

01:37:38.910 --> 01:37:41.450
- I think he slaved the drones.
- It is impossible.

01:37:41.450 --> 01:37:42.910
- Call the guards
- All the phones are down, sir.

01:37:42.910 --> 01:37:45.920
- Then call their cells.
- Their cell phones are not working either, sir.

01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:48.920
- He's locked us out of the mainframe.
- Who's locked you out of the mainframe?

01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:51.460
Please, please, go away.
I got this handled.

01:37:51.460 --> 01:37:52.930
- Have you now?
- Yes I do.

01:37:52.930 --> 01:37:54.930
In fact, if your guy hadn't showed up

01:37:54.930 --> 01:37:57.470
This wouldn't be happening
Please now, go away!

01:37:57.470 --> 01:37:58.930
Thank you.

01:37:58.940 --> 01:38:01.900
Listen we gotta get these bitches outta here.

01:38:01.900 --> 01:38:04.120
You're gonna tell me who's behind
this.

01:38:04.130 --> 01:38:05.900
Who's behind this?

01:38:05.900 --> 01:38:08.490
Ivan. Ivan Vanko.

01:38:08.910 --> 01:38:11.560
- Where is he?
- He's at my facility.

01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:18.350
- I need NYPD please.
- No, no, no honey.

01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:19.550
Don't call the authorities!

01:38:19.670 --> 01:38:22.350
Step aside.

01:38:22.930 --> 01:38:24.520
Tell me everything you know. Go.

01:38:31.900 --> 01:38:35.490
- How we doing Jarvis?
- Remote reboot unsuccessful.

01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:58.930
- No one's answering the phone, what's going on?
- Get in the car. Take me to Hammer Industries.

01:38:58.930 --> 01:39:00.310
I'm not taking you anywhere.

01:39:00.310 --> 01:39:03.650
- Fine. You want me to drive?
- No, I'm driving. Get in the car.

01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:04.150
Nice work, kid.

01:40:05.900 --> 01:40:09.280
- You got multiples coming down on you.
- Let's get this away from the expo.

01:40:14.620 --> 01:40:17.260
When we arrive I need you to watch the perimeter.

01:40:17.330 --> 01:40:19.540
I'm gonna enter the facility and take down the target.

01:40:23.130 --> 01:40:24.680
- Watch the road.
- I got it.

01:40:56.300 --> 01:40:59.300
Listen, listen, a pack has peeled off and headed
back to the expo.

01:40:59.300 --> 01:41:00.470
Got it.

01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:08.650
I'm closing on you!
It's coming in hot, Tony! Watch it.

01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:26.930
- Stay in the car!
- I'm not staying in the car.

01:41:27.210 --> 01:41:29.930
- I said stay in the car.
- What are you wearing?

01:41:32.470 --> 01:41:33.980
Look, I'm not letting you go in there alone.

01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:37.150
- You wanna help? Keep the car running.
- Okay.

01:41:40.980 --> 01:41:43.110
Hey, you can't come in here!

01:42:29.460 --> 01:42:32.720
Each set of drones
is communicating in its own unique language.

01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:36.690
- Choose one and focus on that.
- Have you tried Russian? Why don't you try Russian.

01:43:26.460 --> 01:43:27.840
I got 'em!

01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:44.230
- Rhodey, you're still locked on? - Yeah.

01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:48.490
Drop your socks and grab your
crocs, we're about to get wet on this ride.

01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:51.990
Wait, wait!

01:44:10.770 --> 01:44:12.270
He's gone!

01:44:16.940 --> 01:44:19.410
Sorry buddy, had
to thin out the herd.

01:44:19.550 --> 01:44:21.180
What's your twenty?

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.930
- What are you doing?
- I'm rebooting Rhodey's suit.

01:44:42.470 --> 01:44:43.560
Tony!

01:44:59.960 --> 01:45:01.250
Reboot complete.

01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:05.710
- You got your best friend back.
- Thank you very much, Agent Romanoff.

01:45:05.710 --> 01:45:11.140
Well done with the new chest-piece. I'm reading significantly
higher output and your vitals all look promising.

01:45:11.350 --> 01:45:13.180
Yes, for the moment I'm not dying. Thank you.

01:45:14.180 --> 01:45:16.620
- What do you mean you're not dying? Did you say you're dying?
- That you?

01:45:16.690 --> 01:45:18.480
No, I'm not. Not anymore.

01:45:18.690 --> 01:45:20.900
- What's going on?
- I was going to tell you. I didn't want to..

01:45:20.900 --> 01:45:23.990
- You're gonna tell me you really were dying?
- You didn't let me.

01:45:23.990 --> 01:45:27.780
- Why didn't you tell me that?
- I was gonna make you an omelette and tell you!

01:45:27.780 --> 01:45:31.220
Hey, hey, save it for the honeymoon.
You got incoming, Tony.

01:45:31.230 --> 01:45:32.710
Looks like the fight's coming to you.

01:45:32.710 --> 01:45:34.460
- Great. Pepper?
- Are you okay now?

01:45:34.460 --> 01:45:37.340
- I'm fine. Don't be mad. I will formally...
- I am mad.

01:45:37.340 --> 01:45:40.220
...apologize when I'm not fending off a Hammeroid attack!

01:45:41.130 --> 01:45:43.270
- We could've been in Venice.
- Oh, please...

01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:47.060
Rhodes!

01:45:47.730 --> 01:45:49.440
Snap out of it, buddy!
I need you.

01:45:51.270 --> 01:45:52.820
They're coming. Come on let's roll. Get up.

01:45:56.780 --> 01:45:58.750
Oh man, you can have your suit back.

01:46:02.370 --> 01:46:05.000
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, thanks.

01:46:07.170 --> 01:46:10.190
- Tony, look... I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

01:46:10.190 --> 01:46:12.470
- No I should've trusted you more.
- I'm the one who put you in this position. Forget it.

01:46:12.930 --> 01:46:14.950
No it's your fault. I just wanted
to say I'm sorry.

01:46:14.950 --> 01:46:17.940
Thank you.
That's all I want to hear, partner.

01:46:18.520 --> 01:46:21.820
They're coming in hot. Any
second. What's the play?

01:46:22.860 --> 01:46:25.460
Well we wanna take the high ground, okay.
So let's take

01:46:25.460 --> 01:46:28.590
the biggest gun up on that ridge. - Got you.

01:46:28.590 --> 01:46:30.700
- Where do you wanna be?
- Where you going? - What are you talking about?

01:46:30.700 --> 01:46:33.080
- I mean me.
- I have a big gun, you are not the big gun.

01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:35.530
- Tony, don't be jealous.
- No it's subtle with all the bells and whistles.

01:46:35.540 --> 01:46:38.010
- It's called being a bad ass.
- Fine.

01:46:39.250 --> 01:46:43.190
- Alright. You go up top. I'll draw 'em in.
- But don't stay down here

01:46:43.220 --> 01:46:44.880
it's the worst place to be.

01:46:44.890 --> 01:46:49.040
- Okay you got a spot. Where's mine?
- It's the kill box, Tony, okay, this is where you go to die.

01:47:38.830 --> 01:47:40.420
- See that?
- Yea, yea, nice.

01:47:48.100 --> 01:47:49.140
Rhodey...

01:47:50.770 --> 01:47:51.810
Get down!

01:48:02.780 --> 01:48:05.280
Wow. I think you should lead with that
next time.

01:48:05.290 --> 01:48:09.090
Yeah, sorry boss, I can only use it once.
It's a one-off.

01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:12.840
I told you that five minutes ago.

01:48:14.460 --> 01:48:16.050
That's your guy here.

01:48:17.260 --> 01:48:18.930
- Excuse me?
- Sir, you're placed under arrest.

01:48:19.220 --> 01:48:20.760
Hands behind your back, sir.

01:48:20.760 --> 01:48:22.140
I'm trying to help here.

01:48:26.520 --> 01:48:30.110
I get it. I see what you're doing. Trying
to pin this on me, huh?

01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:34.690
That's good. You start to think like a CEO.
Taking out the competition.

01:48:34.690 --> 01:48:37.970
I like that.
You think you're making a problem for me?

01:48:37.970 --> 01:48:41.170
I'm gonna make a problem for you.
I'm gonna be seeing you again, real soon.

01:48:46.050 --> 01:48:49.970
When they get here, I think you should station them
at the Southeast and both West exits.

01:48:50.510 --> 01:48:52.350
We shut down the seven train in and out of
Willets Point already.

01:48:52.350 --> 01:48:55.480
Well, have city buses there to ferry people
to operating lines.

01:48:55.890 --> 01:48:57.310
You coming with us?

01:48:57.310 --> 01:48:59.240
No, I'm gonna stay until the park is clear.

01:49:02.280 --> 01:49:06.520
Heads up you got one more drone incoming.
This one looks different.

01:49:06.870 --> 01:49:09.170
Repulsor signature
is significantly higher.

01:49:20.090 --> 01:49:21.680
Good to be back.

01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:24.060
This ain't gonna be good.

01:49:27.440 --> 01:49:31.650
I got something special for this guy.
I'm gonna bust his bunker with the ex-wife.

01:49:31.820 --> 01:49:32.950
The what?

01:49:43.830 --> 01:49:46.130
- Hammer tech?
- Yeah.

01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:49.180
We got this.

01:50:42.410 --> 01:50:44.250
Rhodes! I got an idea.

01:50:45.180 --> 01:50:47.000
You wanna be a hero?

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.750
- What?
- I can really use a sidekick.

01:50:49.750 --> 01:50:52.670
- Put your hand up.
- This is your idea?

01:50:52.670 --> 01:50:56.220
- Yup.
- I'm ready, I'm ready, go go go.

01:51:00.020 --> 01:51:01.650
Hit him!

01:51:29.350 --> 01:51:31.230
You lose.

01:51:38.460 --> 01:51:41.220
All these drones are rigged to blow
We gotta get out of here man.

01:51:41.590 --> 01:51:43.140
Pepper?

01:52:22.820 --> 01:52:24.860
Oh my god, I can't take this anymore!

01:52:24.860 --> 01:52:26.030
- You can't?
- I can't take this.

01:52:26.030 --> 01:52:27.380
What do you mean, look at me!

01:52:27.380 --> 01:52:31.530
My body literally cannot handle the stress.
I never know if you're gonna kill yourself...

01:52:31.530 --> 01:52:33.490
or wreck the whole company...

01:52:33.500 --> 01:52:35.800
I think I did okay!

01:52:36.130 --> 01:52:38.080
I quit.
I'm resigning.

01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:40.440
That's it.

01:52:40.440 --> 01:52:43.570
What did you just say?
You're done?

01:52:43.890 --> 01:52:46.140
Surprising, I mean not
surprising.

01:52:46.140 --> 01:52:50.060
I get it.
You don't have to make any excuses.

01:52:50.060 --> 01:52:52.440
- I'm not making any excuses.
- Well you actually were just making excuses.

01:52:52.440 --> 01:52:55.990
I wasn't making an excuse but I'm actually very justified.

01:52:56.090 --> 01:52:57.870
You deserve better.

01:52:58.530 --> 01:53:00.660
You've taken such good care of me.

01:53:01.870 --> 01:53:04.100
I've been in tough spot
you got me through it, so.

01:53:04.160 --> 01:53:06.370
- Right?
- Thank you.

01:53:06.370 --> 01:53:09.750
- Yeah.
- Thank you for understanding.

01:53:09.750 --> 01:53:12.270
- Let's start clean up.
- I'll handle the transition. It'll be smooth.

01:53:12.270 --> 01:53:14.840
What about the press?
Because you only had the job for a week. That's gonna be...

01:53:14.840 --> 01:53:17.890
- With you it's like dog years.
- I know.

01:53:18.180 --> 01:53:19.560
I mean it's like the President.

01:53:31.570 --> 01:53:33.120
Weird.

01:53:33.140 --> 01:53:34.370
No it's not weird.

01:53:34.430 --> 01:53:37.020
- It's okay, right?
- Yeah.

01:53:37.020 --> 01:53:39.670
I think it was weird.

01:53:39.670 --> 01:53:43.070
You guys look like two seals fighting over a grape.

01:53:43.070 --> 01:53:46.660
- I had just quit
- You don't have to do that.

01:53:46.660 --> 01:53:48.280
- I heard the whole thing.
- You should get lost.

01:53:48.280 --> 01:53:50.790
I was here first.
Get a roof.

01:53:50.790 --> 01:53:53.910
- I thought you were out of one-liners?
- That's the last one.

01:53:53.920 --> 01:53:56.590
- You kicked ass back there, by the way.
- Thank you. You too.

01:53:56.820 --> 01:53:59.740
Listen, my car got taken out in the explosions

01:53:59.740 --> 01:54:02.860
so I'm gonna have to hang on to your suit for a minute, okay?

01:54:02.870 --> 01:54:05.140
Not okay with thats.

01:54:05.140 --> 01:54:09.320
It wasn't a question.

01:54:13.800 --> 01:54:15.570
I don't understand...

01:54:34.800 --> 01:54:37.600
I don't think I want you looking at that.

01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:40.270
I'm not sure it pertains to you anymore.

01:54:40.410 --> 01:54:46.430
Now this, on the other hand, is agent
Romanoff's assessment of you.

01:54:46.710 --> 01:54:49.080
Read it.

01:54:49.220 --> 01:54:53.460
Personality overview:
Mr Stark displays compulsive behavior.

01:54:53.620 --> 01:54:56.320
In my own defense, that
was last week.

01:54:58.170 --> 01:55:01.680
Prone to self-destructive tendencies.
I was dying.

01:55:01.760 --> 01:55:04.360
I mean, please, aren't we all?

01:55:04.360 --> 01:55:07.680
Textbook narcissism?

01:55:08.430 --> 01:55:10.900
Agreed.

01:55:12.520 --> 01:55:15.840
Recruitment assessment for Avenger Initiative,
Iron Man, yes.

01:55:15.840 --> 01:55:18.410
- I gotta think about it.
- Read on.

01:55:21.240 --> 01:55:24.580
Tony Stark not recommended?

01:55:25.330 --> 01:55:29.210
That doesn't make any sense. How can
you approve me but not approve me?

01:55:30.440 --> 01:55:35.640
I got a new ticker, I'm trying to do right
by Pepper.

01:55:35.660 --> 01:55:39.390
I'm in a stable-ish relationship.

01:55:39.390 --> 01:55:44.690
Which leads us to believe at this juncture
we'd only like to use you as a consultant.

01:55:50.780 --> 01:55:53.580
You can't afford me.

01:55:55.790 --> 01:55:58.710
Then again I will waive my customary retainer

01:55:58.710 --> 01:56:01.340
in exchange for a small favor.

01:56:02.270 --> 01:56:04.880
Rhodey and I are being honored in Washington

01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:07.430
and we need a presenter.

01:56:09.070 --> 01:56:10.620
I'll see what I can do.

01:56:12.100 --> 01:56:14.270
It is my honor to be here today

01:56:14.270 --> 01:56:18.940
to present these distinguished awards
to Lt. Col. James Rhodes

01:56:18.940 --> 01:56:22.720
and Mr. Tony Stark
who is of course

01:56:22.740 --> 01:56:25.250
a national treasure.

01:56:26.620 --> 01:56:30.500
Thank you Lieutenant Colonel
for such an exceptionally distinguished performance.

01:56:30.500 --> 01:56:33.590
- You deserve this.
- Thank you, sir.

01:56:34.710 --> 01:56:39.930
Mr Stark, thank you for
such an exceptionally distinguished performance.

01:56:40.050 --> 01:56:41.750
You deserve this.

01:56:42.450 --> 01:56:45.020
Oh sorry.

01:56:45.890 --> 01:56:49.990
Funny how annoying a little prick can be, isn't it?

01:56:50.280 --> 01:56:51.860
Let's get a photo.
